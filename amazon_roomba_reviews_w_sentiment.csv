5.0 out of 5 stars,"My dog, as much as I love him, sheds like crazy.  I have laminate floors and it has been a constant battle keeping up with the dog hair everywhere.  People with dogs that shed a lot probably know what I'm talking about, dog hair tumbleweeds and such.  I bought this Roomba and it has been a game changer.I run it daily, either when away from home or in the middle of the night via the scheduling feature on the app.  No more constant battle with dog hair for me.  I was skeptical at first because it just seems to go around in random directions but somehow at the end of the cleaning cycle it manages to get all of my main floor.  I put some 1 inch rubber pads under my sofa legs so the Roomba could fit under it where dog hair seems to accumulate and it goes under and cleans it up.Running it daily also seems to cut down on the amount of dusting I have to do.  It runs on average about an hour and 15 minutes.  It goes under and around my tables, and along the baseboards and when done, docks itself to recharge.  I empty the bin daily to prepare it for its next job.  It is somewhat noisy, but not standard vacuum cleaner noisy so even when I run it in the middle of the night it doesn't wake me.  I would say it is about as loud as  coffee grinder when running.Overall, I'm very happy with it.  It's not something that will perform on the level of spring cleaning but I don't think anyone would expect that.  It will keep your floors mostly clean and dog hair free when run on a daily basis.  I've not tried it on carpet so I can't give feedback on that.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2019",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9953299164772034
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Roomba confirmed that this product will not work with 5 G networks which ATT is in process of upgrading to. If I bought this and they upgraded tomorrow, I would have a useless Robot. Roomba should have disclosed that with a sub window or something before the purchase. When I asked for a replacement they informed me that it was not 250.00 like the one I bought.  It is 500.00 !!! They have 2 models that will  work with either network.  I spent 2.5 hours between phone time and failed installation and I am not happy and feel deceived. If you intend to buy any robot ask these questions.","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9997259974479675
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've heard nothing but good things from friends and family who have Roombas, so we thought we'd give it a try. The first thing we were told was, ""Make sure you spend the money for the real thing: the others may be a lot cheaper, but they're headaches waiting to happen.""  Okay, fine, but the 675 isn't exactly a bank breaker, especially if you get it during a sale. And if we just made our lives easier AND avoided l'agita for less than $250, that's even better.I don't care about packaging until it's inadequate or off-the-charts excessive, and neither was the case here.The setup was breathtakingly simple - I forgot to breathe for a few seconds when I looked at the unit in the charger and after installing/starting the app, pressing 2 buttons, and naming the robot (""Sucka"" - I know, that's so original), I saw that my phone was reporting that setup was complete.  I thought, ""Really, that's it?  What'd I miss?"" As it turns out, I missed nothing. Easy-peasy.  So, I thought I'd just let it charge overnight and then I'd play with it the next day.The next day, while working in my home office, I started the app and selected ""Vacuum Everywhere"".  I heard it wake up with cheerful little beeps and start working.  It really isn't too loud, so between meetings I followed the sound, coffee in hand, to watch it work.  I was kind of fun to watch it careening around like a drunken toddler, gently crashing into stuff and bouncing counter-clockwise until it could move again. I half-expected it to exclaim, ""Uh-oh!""  And if something was light enough, it just pushed it around until it hit something solid enough to make it bounce.  I wish I'd waited until after working hours so that I could watch it with an adult beverage or two.  The 14-year-old in me is definitely going to set up some obstacle tests.Like any toddler, it requires a little bit of supervision. It got stuck on a thick power cable beneath a bed, so it beeped, called out with a voice to ask for help, and alerted my phone app; I rescued it and sent it on its way.  (Note to 14-yr-old-self: see if there's a way to hack the firmware to change the voice alerts to something really wrong. Maybe a toddler-like voice yelling, ""Aw, s**t!"" or ""FML!"")Also like a toddler, it eventually needs a diaper change and a feeding/nap. After a while, I had to empty the dust bin and pull some hair off of the brushes and wheels, so I put it back on the charger for a bit.  So, it's napping right now. After lunch, I'll fire it up again and see if it finds its way into my office.It may need some decoration, too.  Maybe some googly-eyes and a rude bumper sticker? Or a tiny pirate flag flying from the rear?So, for the important part: does it clean well?Yes. Judging from look of the floors and the amount of crud in the dustbin, it does a solid job.  And, apparently, I don't: my weekly floor sweeping/Bona mopping appears to be missing some stuff.Ah, the app tells me that it's already back to full charge (just under 2 hours!), so I'm gonna turn Sucka loose again.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9980670213699341
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this Roomba 675 when it was on sale on Amazon for $200 back in January. It’s a “manual” model (no fancy home-mapping feature), which was just right for finding out whether or not this concept would work for us. It didn’t hurt that it was recommended by The Wirecutter.After running it on manual over the first weekend, I set up a Monday - Wednesday – Friday schedule. By Wednesday of week one, I noticed that the dirt cup was completely full every time, so I expanded the schedule to every day of the week except Sunday.For the balance of week one through Monday of week two, the dirt cup continued to be full at the end of the run. On Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, the dirt cup was less than half full on both days, so I reverted back to the MWF schedule. The dirt cup was only about a third full after it ran on Friday.It looks like we’re finally getting caught up with cleaning the floors downstairs after about a week and a half of running the Roomba almost every day. If the amount of dirt in the cup continues to go down next week, I may cut back to a twice a week schedule.So far, I’m perfectly happy with this model, even if I do occasionally have to get it unstuck or help it find its way back to its charging station before it runs out of battery power. Our downstairs floor is cleaner than it’s been since right after we moved in over two years ago. I don’t think that we need either the whole-house mapping or self-emptying features of the more-expensive models.I have no illusions about never having to use our upright vacuum cleaner again, as the carpets and rugs will need periodic deep cleaning, and there will always be places that the Roomba won’t be able to get to. Manually emptying the dirt cup after each run gives me useful feedback on the efficacy of the current schedule, as well as giving me the opportunity to vacuum off the dirt filter each time (to extend the useful life past he recommended 1 month).Note that I work from home, so I’m here to keep an ear on the Roomba while it’s moving around the house. As it gets stuck about once every time it runs, I’d definitely say that YMMV if you’re planning on running it when you’re not at home (and depending on how many “robot traps” you have).I have noticed that how long it can work depends on where its random path algorithm takes it. The more time it spends on carpeted areas, the shorter the run time—about 70 minutes if it’s staying on carpet, compared to about 80+ minutes on tile or wood flooring.Installing the iRobot Home phone app was a big help, both for the initial setup and for controlling the Roomba. It also generates push notifications if the Roomba gets stuck or confused and needs assistance to resume cleaning.","Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.851760983467102

   We recently replaced much of our carpeting with LVT. After a few days, we noticed dog hair everywhere, especially along the walls. We never realized how the carpeting hid the dog hair. Since we don’t want to sweep several times a day, we decided to buy a Roomba. After reading the reviews of the 694 and other brands, I opted for the 694.We got it today. I plugged it in to charge, downloaded the app and proceeded to set it up. Set up mainly consists of connecting it to your router. You can set up different cleaning routines for different areas of your house or just let it explore.For its maiden voyage, we had it vacuum the dining room. It is raised about 7 inches above the living room and is a distinct separate area. Ideal for a test trial. I created the favorite, Vacuum Dining Room, which just consists of giving it a name and putting Roomba in the room with its base. I started the routine from my iPad and it came out of its base. I quickly realized I needed to pull out the chairs from the table so it could get under them. And, you need to make sure there is enough room for it to get into every area of the room where you want it to clean.The video shows Roomba cleaning the dining room. My husband and I really enjoyed watching it and watching it learn. It got stuck once when it nearly fell off the raised area. It called for help and requested it be moved to another area. I picked it up, put it down and off it went. When it was done, it went to its garage and announced it was done.We decided to give it a shot in a bigger area which included the LVT.While our dog totally ignored it when it was in the dining room, she perked up when it started cleaning in the living room. The photo shows our dog watching it, half asleep. Interestingly, when it headed towards her, our dog just got up and stepped out of the way. Right now it is about 60 feet away cleaning the laundry room. The battery indicator is red and it should be coming home soon. It’s smart so I think it will find its way.Well, Roomba ran out of gas! It sent a message saying it needed to be returned to the base station. We finally found it in a corner of the laundry room, exhausted, near death. After emptying the dust bin, we carried it back to the base station. It is charging now. We will let it fully charge before sending it out again.It is a great device. My only criticism it that it doesn’t alert you when the dust bin needs emptying. So, it can keep running around, unable to pick up more. We do have a very large house, so this may not be a problem for most.","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2021",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9931678771972656

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: amazing vacuum. It picked up so much on its first run.Cons: it’s so much work to follow it around when it gets stuck. It also misses so much. I genuinely bought this just for the location where my cats’ litter box is. I would have thought that it would develop a pattern of vacuuming, but no it’s a complete pinball machine of a vacuum. I’ve had to lock it in the bathroom a few times just to get it to clean decently.I’ve ran it three times so far. Each time for a half hour. It’s consistently missed the same room each time.It’s very loud which wouldn’t be a big deal but it looks like it would have to run for over an hour to clean my small apartment. The noise terrifies my cats and it’s just not worth it.At this point I’m considering returning it for a wireless vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9988738894462585

The first couple of uses I wasn't sure how it was going to work out because it took quite a while to get the area done.  But the AI seems solid.  So now it has learned the layout and has cut the cleaning time in half.The App is really useful.  It has let us know when the irobot has become stuck. We have set it to go off in the morning every other day.  Definitely pick up everything from the floor! (Might be a good way to get the kids to pick up their toys) also close doors to any place you dont want it to go.  Block access to small spaces it could get stuck under.Lol for me, I had a really low bar of expectation it had to meet - I just wanted it to make it back to its docking station! - but the bar was met.My only complaint is that the charging cord is a little lose at the charging station.

   We ordered the vacuum for our new house. We only use it for the open areas of the living room, dining room, kitchen, sun room and bar area. All are wood flooring but 2 area rugs in dining and living room.This is good for daily runs to pick up pet hair, we have 2 dogs and a cat, and dirt from outside. It runs for about 1 1/2 hours and can get most spots. A good purchase for our use.Downfalls are that we still use vacuum to deep clean the carpets since the robot only picks up the hair on the top and suction is not good enouth to get everything.  The furniture isn't moved but the robot still seems to get lost or cannot map the area very well. It runs into the table, couch and end tables all the time. It also doesn't always return to the charging station so you have to find it and put it back on.No issues emptying the bin daily and still feel it was a good purchase. To me, it is not worth the extra money to upgrade and get one that will self empty on its dock since you still have to empty that.","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9961355924606323

   My husband and I bought this Roomba 675 for our first floor that is mostly wooded. We have two cats so it's helpful to manage the cat hair between cleanings. There are quite a few Roomba models out there so we pretty much took a chance on this one because it was on sale at the time. Biggest pros are that you can use Alexa to power it up (see video) and can also fire it up remotely. It picks up a lot of stuff each time it runs and the collection compartment is big enough for our purpose. Biggest cons are that it's louder than I would like so I mostly have it clean while we are not in the house. It gets stuck sometimes (although it seems to be getting smarter as it ""learns"" the room). It also takes a little longer than I would like to find its way back to the dock once instructed.

Much to my dismay, however, this model is a definite step back from the one we previously owned. Here's how:1) The ""plug in"" option to recharge has been removed, meaning that your only option is the contact charger, which is  quite touchy if your floor is not *perfectly* level. We often have to spend 5+ minutes getting the charger to sit right. The auto-dock feature will frequently move the charger itself as it tries to dock, meaning that using it generally just means that the Roomba confusedly pushes around the dock for ten minutes before giving up.2) The ""Max"" feature, which allowed Roomba to clean a room until the battery wore out, has been removed, meaning that frequently Roomba will half-clean a room and then turn off, necessitating multiple manual restarts.  This is super inconvenient if, like us, you like to set Roomba in a large room before you go to bed.3) The wireless features (which are very basic) drain battery, meaning that you can go from a full battery to a dead battery in the course of day unless it is docked (which, see #1, is frequently difficult to do.)4) The audio cues are loud and persistent (they've woken up our sleeping children, even when they're in different rooms) and they can't be turned off.It cleans well.

I mean a robot vacuum going around sweeping, who wouldn't like that? The vacuum works, just let the machine run around a few minutes and you will have debris in he catch tray, vacuums pretty good.  Problem is, you will be getting your broom out and sweeping certain areas anyway because of the missed debris. The spinning brush probably knocks debris out of the way a quarter of the time instead of guiding it to the suction part underneath.  If you have long hair, the spinning brush will only last as long as it takes to make contact with 1 or 2 long hairs before it is rendered immobile, the hair will be wrapped around the brush head. I cannot say this is a smart device either, for it has a hard time finding the charge base home before it has no battery life left. I used this unit largely in a wide open space too, it appears that it has to fumble around the room until it makes direct contact with the charger sensor in order for it to go home, used where you have attached open rooms may not be the best bet for this machine. I could see it working decent in a single large room. Otherwise, you have to buy the boundary devices to keep the unit in a certain area.

They have a reasonably sized home 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 2 car garage, and a basement.The living room gets heavy traffic and after wandering around that room it was almost full of mainly dust balls and hair. I could have let it fill up a little more, but I emptied it. After that it vacuumed the kitchen, foyer and family room(which gets minimal use). The bin was only about half empty after doing these rooms. It preformed all this in under an hour.After using it a second time, there was not a dust smell in the air, and not much dirt in the bin.

It has great range of motion but wanders in a wall to wall motion. Outlining whatever gets in its path, but  will get to troubled spots eventually. It really does good at going along the edge of something and vacuuming. I have not used the scheduled feature or cycle. I have only used the app to start and dock it. Good so far.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9990054368972778

I liked the Roomba's cleaning capabilities and some of the features on the app controller. What made me return this vacuum was that it is very loud and I really could send it back to it's charging station from the app or even control its movements. It was also quite tall compared to some other models, which required me to add some furniture lifts so the vacuum can go under. It's a great robotic vacuum, but I wanted a slimmer and quieter one.

The Roomba connected to my WiFi easily and the app is very simple to navigate. I even set it up to connect to my echo dot. My disappointment started as soon as I said, “Alexa, start the Roomba.” From there, dreams were crushed. I watched in dismay as the Roomba spent 40 minutes cleaning the same 200 ft space. And by cleaning, I mean it kicked around dirt for 40 minutes. I cleaned the filter(it wasn’t very full) and set the vacuum outside of it’s favorite square space of my living room. Then watched it fumble around and do the same for another 30 minutes. I do not recommend this product. Do what I did not, take your money and buy a Dyson.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Roomba after seeing a neighbors house who had it.  As I am finding out, there are ""smart"" Roombas and there are ""stupid"" Roombas.I purchased this 600 series.  My wife and I have a 1300 square foot condo, and thought this would be sufficient.  After using it for a month, I wanted to write a review and tell you what I think.  The idea of the Roomba is great, and apparently if you buy the ""high end"" ones at 6-$700 they do what you need.  I can't see spending that kind of money on a vacuum on a for a small condo.The issues I am finding:1)  This is a ""Stupid"" Roomba.  It does not map the floor plan of your house.  It just goes in whatever direction and cleans.  It will wander into a room, clean a little, and wander in to another room.  The higher end units you can map the house, and also pick the rooms you want to clean.  This just does what it wants with no rhyme or reason.  To sold this, I put it into one room and close the door.  After about 15 minutes  I move it to the next room and close the door.  For a $249.00 Vacuum cleaner, I expect more.2)  It often dies in the middle of the house.  Rather than finding it's way back home after it has run it's own course, it often dies somewhere and does not go back to recharge as it should.3)  While the cleaning works, and it does a relatively good job, there are always objects it has missed.  Again this is the haphazard way it cleans.  The higher end have a row by row capability.  This should be on all Roomba's, no matter what the price.4)  App is inadequate.  Being ""Stupid""  again, you can't change much on the App.  I turned it off for a day here and there, yet it still ran.  I had it set for 2 pm each day.  All of a sudden it is running at 12 noon.  The App still says 2pm, but it has a mind of it's own.  You can't change the time on the App, and you can't pick a room as your only choice is ""Everywhere""5) Get the model with self dumping.  Unless your memory is real good, it is a pain to have to dump the waste bin every day.Overall, I did not expect this to be such a low end product for the price paid.  Would I buy it again?  Probably not.  I can get a good Hoover for $100.00 and I refuse to pay $600 for what is probably a good quality clean.Jim H","Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2021",3 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.914706289768219
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the IRobot because I wanted something to pick up dog hair.  I have 3 Poms who shed continuously so I vacuum every single day.  I thought the IRobot would help with that chore because I have to cut hair off the roller everytime I use my Shark.  After the first use, the roller of the IRobot was full of hair and the small filter box needed cleaning.  The little whirling brush had hair rolled up in it that was twisted so I cleaned it.  It took about 25 minutes to cut hair out of the roller, empty the filter, cut hair off the rollers and the little whirling brush.  My Shark vacuum took less time to just cut hair off brush.  The IRobot is great if you don't have pets.  It was programmed to vacuum every morning at 9 a.m. and it gets under a chair and goes around and around until you move it.  Great idea, but product needs for perfecting before I buy another one.  Needless to say, I returned it.  I'll just keep cutting hair off the roller of my Shark vacuum until someone comes out with a real vacuum for dog hair!","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9991158843040466
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was VERY hesitant about purchasing this product when I initially made the decision to order. I dug around online, checked out videos, read every review I could find. Finally, I decided to go ahead with the purchase after having assured myself that if I wasn’t completely charmed, I’d return it. I was both delighted and surprised to see this thing get to work. I have a household that needs LOTS of vacuuming: two cats, and three people with long, luscious locks. We run Major Tobo (as we have lovingly named our faithful assistant) once a day, and are consistently impressed with the amount of hair and dust that come up. Having the roomba has SIGNIFICANTLY decreased the number of times we need to pull out our Dyson. One half of our home is hardwood, and the other half is carpet- Major Tobo cleans both with ease. The dust bin is very easy to clean out, and we usually have to pull hair out from the bristles, but that’s the case with any vacuum at our house. The roomba genuinely leaves our house looking clean- we can turn it on for a session before having company over and rely on it to have the place looking good when they get here. We’ve had it for just about four months now and the only problem we’ve run into has been it’s habit of getting stuck on the fringe of our carpet, at which point I get a helpful alert to my iRobot app to inform me that Major Tobo is stuck and needs my help. Our cats (one of whom is an anxious boi) do not take rides on the roomba, but they remain unperturbed when Major Tobo is making it’s rounds. Very happy with this purchase, I’d recommended this product to anyone who has a busy schedule and likes to keep a tidy home.","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9970803260803223
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are a lot of similar choices now that the patent expired, but after very careful consideration I chose a Roomba. Why? First, it was on sale for $199. But other than that, my  thinking is that other, newer manufacturers simply cannot beat the experience iRobot has amassed since they invented these things long ago. All the little bits and pieces of feedback they received over the years I believe has made the Roomba machine a solid choice. For example, I was reading reviews for another brand that made clear a common failure was the rubber seal around the filter kept breaking and people had to spend another $9 or so to buy a replacment part, which the manufacturer happily sold you. I believe iRobot fixed all the little fails over the years and the result is a more reliable product. I have owned 3 previous Roombas and I watched each model add little features that addressed preformance and reliability issues.  The fact this model looks only slightly changed from the last one I bought 9 years ago tells me they have perfected it. With other manufacturers, they are still in the learning process and you are the Guinea Pig. Also, I have always received good, if not excellent, customer service from iRobot, which may not be the case, according to customer reviews, with some of the newer manufactuers.  Obviously, the lower prices of newer brands is tempting, and you could say having to spend extra for replacement parts still costs less than a Roomba, and you don't mind the downtime, and the difficulties dealing with their customer service. But, I buy vacuum robots for the convenience and I place a value on reliability and customer service , so I chose to go with the brand I have always had a good experience with and it's worth it to me.","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9910330772399902
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is great for picking up hair and dust. I’m not sure where it is constantly picking up dust from but it is never empty and it’s frequently full of dust in our pet free home. It picks up a ton of those long women’s hairs. We run it 7 days a week on a schedule and it goes for like an hour. It gets stuck on an object like string or a clothing item like once a week. It sometimes doesn’t get in the charger right and won’t charge.  It’s otherwise good for maintenance cleaning. I’d still do a vacuum once a month in a pet free home.My big complaint is that the vacuum bin fills easier than an older model we have for another floor.  It’s almost half the dust capacity so it fills after 2-3 days instead of once a week.  It vacuums like 900 square feet per day.The WiFi feature is cool, the app gives you messages but they’re frequently not correct.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"So what did I, a little old lady from Iowa, know about robots.  I know vacuum cleaners but I leave robots to my grand sons.  What was I expecting?  I had visions of sitting in my recliner with a remote control like the kids use to run their cars, trucks, even airplanes and drones.  I named my Roomba IT and yes it does resemble something out of a Stephen King novel, at least that’s what my dogs think.  IT doesn’t scare the dogs as much as a regular vacuum does.  IT is a lot quieter.  I was kind of disappointed at first until I figured out the best use of IT.  I already knew I had too much furniture and too much stuff around and I quickly learned to clear out spaces and create barriers where I want to clean.  I take it to the bedroom and move stuff off the floor, then close the door and let IT run.IT’s favorite room is the kitchen breakfast room.  IT happily runs across the floor and does an amazing job of getting under the edges of the cabinets.  In part of the living area I use a swiffer with  a long handle to keep IT on the path I choose.  We work pretty well as a team.  The good thing is that even picking IT up and herding it around my back doesn’t hurt at all afterwards like it wouldIf I pushed the big vacuum around.  So I’m still disappointed that it doesn’t have a remote controller, but it does pick up lots of dust and dog hair.","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9983770847320557

4.0 out of 5 stars,"So torn. I might have some buyers remorse on this one, wishing I had tried out one of the offbrand that had more features.  It is much more expensive with less features, and lately the off brands have come a long way and are highly rated.Efficiency: This thing will drive you nuts if you watch it bc it will go in a million different directions and not towards the crumbs you are staring at. Will it eventually get those crumbs? Maybe. Probably? In an hour by chance? Wish I could have bought 3 different models and tried them out but alas—it’s mine now, so DJ Roomba is here to stay. It is MUCH louder than I anticipated so I run it when gone. I like that it works with google. It rarely finds the dock, but I knew ahead of time that my docking station would lend to that (under a desk in a corner, out of eye site). I’m ok with that.Use: One reviewer nailed it by telling us: deep clean floors first. Then introduce the roomba daily for maintenance. I like this plan. There IS ALWAYS dust/hair in the bin even with daily use of this guy. And we have no pets and keep a clean house! How did I live with that prior to DJ Roomba in da house?! I can’t go back now!Ps - it went on Black Friday sale a week after I bought it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this Roomba model for a little over a week now and love it. It does a great job on our hardwood, tile, and low-pile rugs. Of course, this model doesn't do mapping of your floor plan, but I've noticed that it still hits most places every day. I also love that it self-docks. To help it focus on the higher-traffic areas (kitchen, dining room, living room), I close the doors to all the other rooms a couple of days a week so it stays in those high-traffic areas for its full cleaning time. Depending on your style of furniture and where cords are located, you might want to to also get some Command cord clips to clip your cords along the baseboards so they are out of the roomba's way. I would recommend being home the first couple of times it runs so you can see what areas might cause obstacles and problems and figure out solutions for those. Overall, it's a great product that does exactly what I wanted for the price I paid for it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9992961883544922

I sweep every day sometimes twice a day. I wasn’t sure this would be strong enough to pick up the pet hair or go on my carpet. I must say I am so pleasantly surprised! I’ve only had it three days and it takes awhile for it to cover all the floor space I have. But it goes with any hesitation from hard wood flooring over the thresh holds onto the carpet. It gets under my end tables, coffee tables and kitchen table without me having to move them to sweep with the regular vacuum. It has great suction and picks up all the pet hair!

Apparently, they make a difference. This Roomba has a bristle brush and a rubber one. The bristle brush is a PAIN to clean and it needs it often. There are 3 girls in my house with long hair and this bristle brush gets clogged up SUPER fast. Long hair is hard on vacuums anyway, but the design and style of the brush causes the hair to knot and tangle in the bristles resulting in a long, tedious process cleaning it out about once every other week.So, if I ever get another one, I will specifically search for two rubber brushes.","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9720824956893921

However, Norbert does a surprisingly good job.  He has not fallen down the stairs either which is a huge plus.We have found that if we lock Norbert in a room by himself that he does a better job than if you give him full run of the house.  His mind has a tendency to wander a little in that regard so constraining his territory makes it more likely that he'll find all of the cat hair ""tumbleweeds"", litter, dirt from outside and other stuff that happens to hit the floor.Norbert, despite his relatively low IQ and seemingly random movements, apparently recognizes both of our cats and apparently has an appetite for cat tails.  Our furry friends have decided that avoiding Norbert's brushes and wheels is best and make for high ground when they hear him start his cleaning routine.Overall, Norbert joining our house has made our lives easier by giving us time to no longer do the vacuuming ourselves and instead spend time watching him creep across the floor, under chairs and into some of the areas of our house that we realize that we should have vacuumed ourselves before he came into our lives.  Never has an animated object garnered such attention and entertainment in our house from all of use (cats and humans).  We cheer every time he finds a chunk of dirt and face-palm when he bumps into the same four legged chair for a few moments.

I found myself watching it work on the flooring it would travel on - no rhyme or reason and that drove me nuts. Now I admit- this was MY problem for watching it do it’s job. So - should you buy one (which BTW - if you have mainly uncarpetted or lower pile carpeting - go for it! What a wonderful convenience) do one of two things. Either buy the Roomba with the mapping feature OR leave the house or work on a different floor of the house so you don’t see the irrational pattern flow (it does seem to EVENTUALLY hit all the spots.3.) it did not return to the docking station as it was suppose to.Let me close by saying I really really wanted to love this machine - the reality of under beds and furniture getting vacuumed on a regular basis made me giddy.

So, how did I learn all about this - 3 hours working with the Roomba tech support. Very nice people but they just have a bad product wifi config setup. I finally gave up when they wanted me to disconnect my satellite wifi station (in the attic), disconnect all my other devices, and reconfigure my router to only 2.4 GHz (hard coding) to get past the setup screen.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received “Brenda” today and she worked really hard for over an hour on my floors! 😂 Here’s what I think so far... In order for Brenda to perform at her fullest you need to prep your space. Unplug the cords and lift them off the floor, so that Brenda doesn’t choke on them while working. Same goes for anything else that she can trip on. You will need to watch her the first time to get an idea of how she behaves in your space. I live in Las Vegas in a 1300sq ft home. House layouts here can be a little tricky and since my Brenda doesn’t have a mapping feature I need to think for her in order to make her job a bit easier. For example, in order for her to clean my large living room efficiently, I need to put up a barricade so she doesn’t go into my hallway area and then into one of the bedrooms. I also have a pony wall in the living room so that confuses her a little bit too. However, she did perform to the fullest on her first run and collected a lot of fine dust, dog hair and other random particles. I recently got rid of all carpets in favor of  luxury vinyl floor planks. Brenda seems to like this surface a lot! Like some reviewers I also had an issue with her not being able to go home to charge. She seemed to want to park herself near the WiFi router but her dock was in the living room. So I moved her condo to the office where the router is and just like magic she made it back home in a snap. I also think that in order for hear to clean each room efficiently she needs to be locked in there instead of letting her wander the house.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I love this thing. Most of my house is hardwood so dirt and hair show pretty quick. I was really surprised by how much hair and dirt this thing picked up. The robot runs for about 1.5 hrs before needing to recharge which was also nice. Cons:  it sometimes loses connection with the WiFi and it has to be reset. The suction is good but doesn’t get a lot in the cracks in the hardwood. Overall, I would purchase again and am planning another to help with coverage of the house.","Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.769707441329956

The area rug in the living room catches a lot of cat hair and I wanted to use this, in particular, to clean this rug - it's mostly black and needs constant attention.

At least 20% of the time it does mid-job and we just find it somewhere.

Also gets under beds, sofas and rolls over wires and doesn't get caught up in them.The only negative is that it is noisy when operating. So I always program it to clean when I am gone, or turn it on just as I leave the house. You just have to plan and use it wisely, and this little bot is a very good investment.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"First time purchasing an automated vaccuum cleaner. I have 2 kids, 2 dogs and high traffic from and to the back patio, so I was looking for some help on controlling the dirt.  The WiFi configuration was confusing and after 20 unsuccessful minutes I delegated that task to husband, which in 5mins he got it down. So, I could argue that it may not be userfriendly on the set up for some.  The first time we turned it on, was in the afternoon, and I thought it was loud. I'm running it now at night, after the kids go to bed, and it's definitely loud. =S  You won't be able to watch TV or listen to music while it runs, even in the day time and could possibly wake up light sleep kids at night.  I'm not sure when is the best time to run it if you're at home all day.  The random wondering around can be frustrating considering one could clean a 20x20 room in 10mins, yet it takes 90mins to clean and still misses some areas.  Despite the time it takes and the loudness, it does a good job (not excellent) but it does pick up lots of dirt. The suction on a low area rug is not strong (it didn't pick up all the shedding hair from the dogs). I have yet to let it run in the bedroom high carpet areas, but I don't have high expectations on it doing a good job there.  Overall, I'd give it a high 'A-' grade on wooden floors cleaning since the vaccuum was quite full when we emptied it and the floors did feel cleaner in the end. However it gets a C+ on carpet cleaning, which it only passed through my low area rug and it didn't do a good job on fully cleaning it (forget a deep clean) despite the multiple time going over the same spots.I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it. The loud noise is a big factor since we're all at home due to Covid, the kids with virtual learning and us working remotely, I can't just let it run and disrupt the school/work day. I'd like a quieter one and with a more strategic and controlled vaccuming tragectory to save time, but I see that those models are quite more expensive than what I'm willing to pay. I say it's a good enough purchase if you're not at home and you're okay with area rugs lightly vaccumed and some floor areas not vacummed over. I'd say it's not worth paying the full price, so wait for the next holiday event to get it at a discount, as I did for Black Friday.  Will keep you posted if I find a better one.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9994292855262756

   I love this robot! We call it Rosie (after the robotic maid in The Jetsons). I cannot stop talking about this with my friends who don't own one already. In fact, I actually just gifted 3 roomba 675's within a month of purchasing this one. It does a very thorough job of cleaning and at the beginning would take over an hour to clean our living room. But over time, it has adapted to our room and now takes about 45 minutes to do a sweep of the living room (about 400 sq ft.). It's great that this is able to connect to the virtual wall barrier as we use it divide our kitchen from living room. We run maintenance activities around once a month (hair removal, wheel clean-up) and it's not too much to do (takes 10-12 mins) especially when the robot does the cleaning for you everyday and saves time! I spent about 14-15 hours doing research on various roomba models, and I must say that at this price, this entry level model is a steal! It works just as good as the i3 or i7. If you have a single level home, I highly recommend this model. If you have a multi-level house, I would suggest an i7 since it can save the maps and remember the rooms. Over time, we have also noticed that the robot has adapted to our room and now takes a more regular path versus completely random zig-zag. It also connects via wifi, so we have it connected with our Alexa and just say 'Alexa, clean our house' and it does everything and re-docs after its done.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9431747198104858

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This vacuum does a good job cleaning, and it is very convenient that it can be programmed to start early in the morning, or from a smartphone, but...It's also supposed to return to its charging station, and that's something it does very rarely. More commonly, it chokes on something forgotten on the floor, but which is a bit inconvenient, or its battery dies while it tries to find its way back. And it's that last that has me quite annoyed, as it seems to be a really bad error in its programming.When the vacuum gets stuck, I can at least open the app and hear it (usually) complain. When its battery dies, though, it won't respond to the app at all, and I have to hunt all over the house to find it. Surely it could be programmed to give up finding its way back while it still has battery left? The chances that trying just a few minutes longer will result in success seem kind of low if it hasn't actually detected the charger, so it might just as well give up and save its battery.And speaking of which... there should really be a 'find' button on the app so that I don't need to quit it and start over again to get it to make noise.A few years ago, this was probably state-of-the-art.

My issue with it is the following which aren't really deal breakers but things that you should know before buying.1.Sometimes it doesn't dock well so it won't charge. So you'll find yourself a dead Roomba with half the job done or worse yet one that is docked and didn't start at all2. Even if you have the space for the dock as recommended if it's too far way... Let's say in a hallway it won't find it.3. If the wheels are wet it won't get enough traction to climb over small borders like a balcony rail. So those are tedious with wet floors.4. Storage capacity kinda sucks especially with alot of pet hair has to be emptied after every clean.5. Works with Alexa but it's not an instant response so let say you tell Alexa ""start Roomba"" Alexa will respond ""welcome to robot home for electric powered vaccumm like Brava.... Roomba... Something else, I can help you do things like ""start Roomba"" what will you like to do?"" Which is well annoying having to wait 15-16 seconds every time.6.

If you have a glass of wine on a side table, it will run smack into that table and your wine will spill (which reminds me, I need to get some stemless wine glasses). I guess I was expecting more. I had a Hoover robot vacuum and the app to run it was terrible and after a year the whole thing stopped working completely BUT it would sense things and stop before running into it, and prior to first use, it ran a cycle and scanned your house for a map (we had to redo ours because it thought the dog was a piece of furniture and would never vacuum over that spot lol). You could see on the map where it went, and it had a very sensible back and forth pattern, similar to what you'd do with a regular vacuum. The Roomba just literally runs around like a chicken with its head cut off. Sometimes it gets my living room, other times all it does is the hallway before heading back to dock (and the battery is FULL). I'm hoping maybe it gets better the more runs it does but I've seen similar complaints. It's also pretty loud compared to my last one. The only pros compared to my previous one is that it is thinner and can easily fit under our couches and cabinets. It also can play a sound if you can't find it.

Sure enough, I covered the sensors (there's no stair access for the roomba on my main level) and it would go on the carpets! But it did an awful job. Literally driving over the top of visible dog and cat hair and not picking it up. Needless to say, not what I was hoping for. The final straw of my 1 week trial with it was when it died in the middle of the hallway for the SECOND time, instead of returning to base when it's battery was low. I emailed tech support and they informed me that my main level being 1200 sq ft is too much for a roomba that doesn't have the mapping software, and I would have to buy a virtual wall to keep it within 600 square feet so it didn't get so far from the base station and die.

I had measured the height underneath and the height of the Roomba but yet it still wedges itself under the front edge of dresser even tho the Roomba is 1/4"" taller. Kinda dives under at an angle then grinds its tires trying escape. You literally have to wiggle and pull to get it unstuck.After several months we gave up and bought a thinner competitors model and moved this Roomba to the first floor. Now it has a new list of negative habits... it gets stuck daily on one of the thin throw rugs. If it doesn't ball it up underneath then it simply won't traverse the edge. Many times it gets onto the rug then will not drive itself off the edge back onto the hardwood.Very very disappointing because it does a decent job of picking up dust dirt and dog hair when it is actually running but unfortunately it is stuck more often than it runs.Our older model Roomba without WiFi and edge sensors did a much better job of not getting stuck and completing a cleaning cycle.The competitors model purchased for the upstairs is half as loud, fits under most of our furniture, runs much more smoothly with less bumping into objects and has a longer runtime.

   This was going to be my first robotic vacuum, if I hadn’t returned it. First, just as I unboxed it i noticed that it was packaged so that one of its sweeping bristly white brushes was bent in the cardboard  (see pic) so bad that it was angled upward making it unable to sweep anything. Which was weird because this is supposed to be a good brand you’d think someone would take care to package it carefully so as not to damage it’s own product...Second it really does just roll randomly and cleans in an unorganized way and I think I’d rather try the higher end model that cleans in a systematic pattern making the product more efficient...Lastly the robot would not “go home” back to its charging station. I tried placing it in 3 different areas of my home no stairs and no clutter in front and on it’s sides. Through the app I would press “stop job & go home” on my cell, the green dock light would illuminate on the roomba but it wouldn’t change course it just kept on cleaning around furniture.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9997612833976746

A couple days in, the rug was as clean as the first day I bought it, and the rest of the house was cleared of dog hair! This roomba exceeded my expectations. My house in general is very clutter free, and has tile floor in the main areas. I only let it run in my living room, dining room, kitchen and hallways. The bedrooms have very dense carpet, and this is not made for that, which I knew when I bought it. As long as you keep all cords tucked away and clutter out of its way, it is worth the buy!

   I bought both the eufy and Roomba robot vacuums but I have to say I preferred the eufy brand. I did some research for many months on the type of robot vacuums to get and glad I went with eufy. Roomba is a very popular brand and there’s a lot of rave about it but I honestly don’t know why that is. It is super loud when cleaning and gets aggressive when it hits obstacles. It has a random motion like other robo vacs in the price range so I didn’t see why it was much better than other robot vacuums. I also loved that my eufy came with a remote control which the Roomba doesn’t and I find that handy if I want to quickly clean a particular spot. Here are the pros and cons to the Roomba but I’ll go with eufy!PROS:-Since it’s a popular brand, it’s been known for its reliability.-Voice notifications from the robot-Easy to use app-I like the detailed cleaning notification on the app-Alexa enabled-You can click the home button from the robot itself. I didn’t like that my eufy didn’t have this function but luckily the newer model does.CONS:-Super loud!! Yes that is a huge turn off!-Bigger than eufy so makes it hard to go under furniture-Quite aggressive when cleaning..when it reaches obstacles it always wants to push through rather than go a different direction.In conclusion I prefer my eufy to Roomba.","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9957374930381775

4.0 out of 5 stars,"BOTTOM LINE: My floors have never been cleaner. As a busy young professional I simply cannot compete with something that will vacuum for 90 minutes per day, every single day.  For that reason I will likely be a lifelong customer of robot vacuums, most likely this brand.That being said, this device is not without issues.  The primary thing that I run into is that it gets stuck 90% of the time.  That's fine with me, and this point I just expect it, and then move it when I get home.  It will get stuck behind a couch, it will get stuck on staircases, it will get stuck if it runs over a shirt.  The other major problem is that it won't necessarily clean the entire house it'll just clean a certain area and think it's done.  If it goes into a room and then manages the shut the door of that room, then it will vacuum that area and then stop.  There's no map in this version so it just mindlessly roams and sometimes that's just in a smaller space.The last thing that I wish was different, was the loud ""ROOMBA STUCK"" announcement at 3am, if you forgot to re-dock the vacuum. Or, if the Roomba decides it's not placed optimally on the charging station, the vacuum will turn on and then move around a bit until its in a better spot (again in the middle of the night).All of that being said, this just feels like we are in the beginning stages of an excellent technology.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a 1044 square foot condo in May (one floor). I also own a very messy cat who likes tossing kitty litter out of her box. I have tried a lot of things to contain the mess but nothing works. I figured I could buy this and it would be able to clean that mess up perhaps daily and it would help keep my floors clean. So I went ahead and purchased it.The first time I used it, it only cleaned the carpet in the living room running over the same spots again and again and again (which wasn't even that dirty, really). I let it go for about 15 minutes but had to stop because it was getting late and I didn't want to keep my downstairs neighbors up. Ah, yes, the sound. Let's discuss that.It is not quiet. It's quieter than a traditional vacuum, sure, but sometimes when the wheels are pointing a certain way on the hardwoods, tile or vinyl, it does make rolling noise that I'm sure my neighbors are hearing. Since it runs for a VERY LONG TIME (more on that later), even though it's not as loud as a traditional vacuum cleaner, it's super annoying anyway.I let Anastasia (they want you to name them on the app) clean again the next day, this time uninterrupted with free and reckless abandon. She cleaned for one hour and 16 minutes. The only ""prep"" work I did was to remove all cat toys from the floor. She did an OK job in living room and kitchen and dining areas, however, she knocked into my cat's water bowl twice, spilling water everywhere. Note to self: remove cat bowls before starting. She ran over cords  (I was worried about that but she did well--no damage), she ran into a boot tray with winter boots on it, knocking it about 2 feet away but she did not get stuck, much to her credit. Note to self: remove boot tray before starting. She also knocked door stops out of under doors and moved those over a couple of feet. Note to self: remove door stops before starting. She had trouble with dining room chairs, and going under the table. Note to self: pull the chairs out slightly to give her more room. Even though she was running for an hour and 16 minutes, she missed two rooms: one small bathroom and one bedroom. Not sure why. She got stuck under one dresser in a bedroom and could not extricate herself. She had to be manually removed (and it wasn't easy).I looked in her bin and it was pretty full, much to my shame and embarrassment. Wow. I didn't realize my house was that dirty. Thanks Anastasia!Next time I ran her (after removing the cat dishes, door stops, cat toys, and boot tray), she ran for about 59 minutes until out of sheer annoyance I stopped her manually because it was just too annoying to let her continue. I could barely hear my TV. I thought, people are probably running her when they aren't home. She went over the same spots over and over and over again. She did venture further into the rooms she had missed before, the bathroom and bedroom but she didn't do the entire bedroom. I read online that the more you use her, the better she will get. The jury is still out on that one.  She went under that same dresser she got stuck under previously, this time without issues. She extricated herself just fine.  Again, the bin was quite full and I even found an SD card in it! I panicked for a few minutes, wondering if SHE had an SD card in her which I knocked loose, then realizing, no, she must have sucked this up from the floor in a bedroom or something. Whew!The last time I ran her, she again ignored that second bedroom again. I picked her up by her handle, and placed her in that bedroom, where she happily cleaned for a little while but missed sections of it, then left, never to return. I noticed some white paint on her from my baseboards as well.Next time I ran her, she did over an hour. Again, the drill: pick up cat toys, pick up boot tray, pick up water bowl, pick up door stops, pull out dining room chairs, pull out stools from island. Ugh. That is when I wondered to myself, is this even worth it? Seriously? I thought about it and said well, if I was manually vacuuming, I would be taking the same precautions, right? I wouldn't be running over cat toys with it. I let her continue and manually stopped her after a little over an hour. This time her bin was not quite as full. Finally, my house is clean?!?!? So basically, I have not allowed her to run more than an hour while I'm home because it's just too annoying. However, I don't feel comfortable letting her rip while nobody is home in case she gets stuck or does damage.Anyway, now for the good and the bad:  The good is that she does a decent job picking up debris, food particles, cat food particles, kitty litter, dust bunnies and hair. She does a fine job of docking herself. She hasn't actually destroyed anything. That's it for the good.Now for the bad: you have to do a lot of prep work before running, she runs for over an hour which is annoying, she goes over the same spots over and over again and totally misses other spots, so there is constant babysitting involved, which negates the cleaning when you aren't home benefit. If you have to constantly prep your area, and babysit this thing, is it worth the money? I say no. It's not. It would be faster, easier and cheaper to just run a regular vacuum around the house.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used a Roomba for about 3 weeks and sent it back. It is by no means a way to keep your house clean the way a manual vacuum does. It misses areas and the battery runs out before it finishes cleaning all areas. My carpet is a charcoal color and it wouldn’t vacuum it at all. After researching this, it’s a flaw in the computer that thinks my dark carpeting is a cliff. There are a couple ideas on YouTube to fix it but they are not an acceptable solution for me. It also bumped into my light colored wood trim and scuffed it up quite a bit. I would NOT recommend buying one.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first roomba, though my parents had one over ten years ago so that was my only point of comparison. I assumed that it would have advanced a lot since then, but I think the main way in which it is different is that they've improved how much you need to clean the roomba itself. I have two cats and live in a 670 sq ft apartment with carpet and hardwood floors. This roomba is great for people on a budget! I think they easily could have included some of the nicer features of the more expensive ones in this base model, but I understand that they probably spent lots of money on researching the tech and need to make it back. Here's a pros/cons list:Pros:- This little guy has an instantly cute personality. He sings a little song when he successfully docked (more on that in the cons section) and is so stupid with the way it knocks into stuff that it's charming.- My floors are so clean all the time. I'm on the messier side and all of the surfaces in my apartment are so much dirtier than my pristine floors! It really does a good job of actually cleaning.- I thought it might struggle on carpet but it actually likes carpet and arguably does better on it than hardwood. I think this is another way in which it's improved since my parents had one. It can keep moving even with level changes of around an inch in height with no problem.- It can cover my small apartment well in about 30m, which is pretty good considering its path is random.- I have had it for a few months, but I haven't had to clean any of the brushes yet (it claims it'll let me know when I need to). Will update if cleaning them is a pain. But the back compartment that you empty is super easy to clean and pretty clean to do as well! That's rare for emptying vacuums. All you do is unhinge this plastic cover over the trash can and then put it back after the dirt falls out. Easy!Cons:- I get not including some features from the nicer models for reasonable business purposes. However, there is no reason that the dock needs to be hollow and light as a feather. This makes it so much harder for the roomba to dock as it SUCKS at docking. Even when approaching in a straight line super carefully it still messes up and misses around half or even more of the time. The design of the dock needs to be redone because the roomba's terrible docking success rate is just embarrassing and unnecessary. Though the song it sings of success after finally docking after multiple failed attempts makes the success all the cuter. But not worth it. Please redesign the dock roomba people! The literal least you could do is make it heavier so it doesnt get pushed around when the roomba misses. (This docking issue is the main reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)- If you're getting this to be lazy about cleaning, just be aware that you will need to be on top of picking things up off the floor that the roomba could get stuck on or knock over such as wires, food bowls for pets, shoe laces, etc. If you forget to protect these types of items the roomba always manages to go directly for those things as the first thing it does, almost like it's doing it on purpose.- The scheduling aspect is there so that in theory the roomba can be on while you're not home. I personally don't feel comfortable doing this because it is quite stupid and gets stuck sometimes or needs help docking. So I try to be around when it's doing its thing, but it is pretty loud so it's not the most relaxing thing in the world.Overall, for the money, this is an amazing purchase and I highly recommend it. The biggest con is definitely the docking aspect, but it really isn't enough to negate the fact that I don't have to vacuum anymore and my floors are always on point. If you have the money, it might be worth getting the more expensive models because I wish that the roomba could map out my apartment and I could tell it which rooms to clean. The self-emptying dock sounds amazing as well. Now if I could just get a robot to hang my clothes back up for me...","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021",2 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9977664351463318

1.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought 2 Roombas about 6 months ago to clean 2 separate floors in our house, and it was a challenge from the start. It's gone downhill since. This review will describe the product in the first weeks and recent month.1. First weeks. They did a good job of picking up pet hair (2 large dogs) and child crumbs and filth. I liked how they can ""dig"" around chair feet to grab hair that was stuck to the chair feet. But they were LOUD. So loud that they could not be used unless we were out of the house or put on headphones. They weren't very ""smart"" in that they didn't seem to cover ground efficiently, but they ""usually"" got the job done. I say usually, because as often as not, they wouldn't find the base, or they would have trouble docking and couldn't charge. The base is so light that when the vacuum tries to dock, the base just spins around with it. It helps to put a rug underneath if you're on hardwood, but this is not foolproof. Sometimes, they would get lost and didn't make it back to base at all, so I often had to play ""find the Roombas"" with the kids. The Roombas missed charging often enough that I didn't even bother trying to set up the programed features, so I can make no comments about the programs. Still, my house was more clean, so I dealt with the noise and charging hassle without too much annoyance.2. Recent month or so. As I said, it's gone downhill. Neither Roomba charges at all without some intervention on my part. As you can see from the photos, one must have a very heavy stone weight placed at a certain location to the right in order to charge. The second one must have a lift from underneath. Even with these interventions, neither Roomba charges fully, ever. The one with the cardboard underneath only runs for about 20 minutes before dying in a random location. The one with the heavy weight runs about 40 minutes before death. Well short of the 90 minute run time they claim. In turn, my house isn't clean, and the fur piles are starting to accumulate.Based on the very short life span of these devices, a 1-star rating is in order. I am currently browsing for other robot vacuum options.","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9956339001655579
3.0 out of 5 stars,"A Roomba is the equivalent of a lazy teenager with a vacuum cleaner. Rather than start in one area and carefully sweep side to side making sure to clean every square foot, the teenager and the Roomba randomly zig zag around the room maybe cleaning 70% of the floor and call it done. That's a Roomba - the lazy zig-zagging teen. We own a 2000 square foot home with carpeted bedrooms and hard surfaces in the living areas with area rugs. We have 2 dogs and so there are dust bunnies and pet hair scattered around. We bought the Roomba mainly so that when we leave, it would clean the hard surfaces and collect all the pet hair. It does not. It will zigzag around randomly for 45 minutes. When the cycle is done, the Roomba is full of pet hair and dust. Where it goes, it does clean very well. However, it does not clean everywhere. Imagine you have a large square room that is empty. Imagine an even coat of dust on the entire floor. After a Roomba cycle, imagine a bunch of zigzag lines where it cleaned some of the dust and left some behind.Bottom line, we paid $300 for a machine that will run randomly about the house, often get stuck on or under something and stop. When it does complete a cycle, it will be full of dirt, but we still need to use the vacuum to clean all the pet hair that was left behind. If you have lots of hard surfaces and want to come home to a floor completely clean, you'll either need to hire a maid or vacuum yourself. As I mentioned in the header, where it goes it cleans, but it goes randomly about and leaves lots behind where it doesn't go.Not sure we'd buy one again.","Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2021",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9988383054733276
2.0 out of 5 stars,"It looks like my last Roomba but thats the only similarity. It struggles in ever way. It is not nearly as powerful as my olf iRhomba in any way. First it struggles at the carpet edges to transition onto them from my hardwood. I have flat non plush rugs and it just pushes up my carpet edges like there is a wall versus moving onto them over that simple height. So it has yet to return to base before getting stranded because there is always some carpet to climb which it treats like a wall. The battery life is about 45 minutes. So the wireless feature to locate it is useless because by the time it stops from struggling against fictitious walls (rug edges) , the battery is too low for it to respond.  Next, the brushes don't get clogged up with pet hair nearly as often as my first iRomba but it's likely because the quality of suction just didn't or couldn't pick any pet hair up.  So when I empty the debri chamber (which holds half the old iRomba capacity due to the oversized filter in it)  it is generally filled with lint only.... Never cereal, a pin and defintely not a penny or anything heavy like the older IRomba handled. So those those non rubber brush may look like they can do something but im comparison, it don't really address much due to the weak suction.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.996167004108429

And it’s not very quiet, so you might as well just vacuum yourself because it’s gonna take 5x as long for it to bump into the places that need to get cleaned.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9976274371147156

5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you’re looking to never use a hand vacuum ever again, then this is not for you; because you will be severely disappointed.This is a machine that will bump its’ way around your home and travel in no particular direction. However, that is exactly what you signed up for. This model of the Roomba does not have a mapping feature, so to ask why it wonders around aimlessly is pointless. If you’re looking for a machine that’s going to replace your hand vacuum forever and clean as efficiently as a cleaning service, then you might need to look at the $700+ models that DOES have a mapping feature and higher specs. This $200+ is more or less a base model and is not ever going to replace your hand vacuum.I have myself and one dog in a 700 sq ft apartment (no stairs; but lots of floor rugs!) There is a consistent layer of dog and human hairs on the carpet and floorboards. What the Roomba does, is it zooms around my apartment during the week, picking up stray hairs and dust bunnies as well as get under the coffee tables and cupboards. Getting to those harder to reach places; or items of furniture I’m always too lazy to move out of the way to vacuum. This means that in between the times that I use my hand vacuum (about once a week), I don’t have a crazy amount of dog hair floating around and I don’t need to go out of my way to vacuum in those hard to reach places. It has had no trouble at all climbing over all of my area rug, doormats, bathroom rugs (high pile with tassels!) or any of the multiple smaller area rugs in the hallway or the bedroom.You do need to clean the dustbin out after each use, and it says that as part of the maintenance. Running this Roomba for an hour in my 700 sq ft apartment, with one dog and one human’s worth of hairs will fill up the dust bin. If you’re buying this to run continuously in your 3000 sq ft home; again you’re going to be very disappointed. Owning this particular model of the Roomba, there are going to be some limitations. You can’t compare a $200 product to a $700+ product and expect that they perform the same way with the same bells and whistles. If you’re looking for a robot vacuum that picks up the hairs and dust that life throws at you in between deep cleans, then this is for you.Customer Service with the iRobot team has also been great.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little robot makes me regret ever having given any other item a 5-star rating.  The fact that any other purchase shares a rating with this Roomba somehow feels like sacrilege.  If only I'd known the degree to which this little semi-sentient cylinder would take on an air of the sacred, perhaps I would have done everything differently.  For starters, I would have gotten one sooner - much sooner.If Amazon would let me pick just one purchase and give it a 7-star rating, it would be this one.The first week with this little robot was very telling.  We could run this thing on what we thought was a clean floor, only to find its dust bin clogged with filth.  We repeated this twice a day for a week, constantly in awe of the amount of detritus that was making the transition from our floors to our trash can.  We run this every night now, so things have settled down a LOT in the filth department.  It's difficult to even think of those dark days when a bare foot or a white sock would be darkly stained after a quick jaunt through our home.You may be thinking to yourself:  ""There's too much junk on my floors.""  ""The kids' toys are everywhere.""  ""What if it hits a wet mess?""  ""It's going to tangle up a power cord.""  ""It's going to be a pain to empty.""  ""I can just vacuum the old-fashioned way.""Stop. Stop. Stop.  Why do you treat yourself this way?Knowing that a machine is about to vacuum every square inch of home while you do something else WILL CHANGE YOU.  It will change the way you live.  Cleaning up the clutter will no longer be an unrewarding drudge.  Organizing your power cords will bring you joy.  Everything you do that clears a path for this little mechanical joy emitter will make you feel like a hero.  You will become attuned to any mess that could possibly interfere with the Roomba's sacred mission.  Don't worry about whether the Roomba will fit into your life.  It will change your life.Emptying the bin takes 30 seconds, most of which is a walk from the charging station to the trash can.  Everything on this robot that needs maintenance or cleaning is designed to easily pop out and pop back in.  Once a month, I pop out the rollers and cut out the accumulated hairs (we're a long-haired people).  That takes a few minutes, depending on how thorough I want to be.  I put in a clean filter occasionally - another 10 seconds.Other tidbits:* This vacuums under my sofa and bed.* Last month, I put my Oreck upright in the attic.  It hadn't been touched in months.* I hooked this up to my Google Home account, so I just say ""hey Google, run the vacuum"" to turn this on sometimes.* It reminds me of when I was a child and I didn't much care about leaving a mess because I knew someone else would take care of it.* My kids love it, and they have learned that whoever wins the ""toy cleanup championship"" gets to push the button to turn it on* This feels like one of those technological advances that will completely consume its predecessors.  Children won't understand why old phones had rotary dials or why old vacuums had handles.Twenty years from now, I'm going to look back on 2020 as the year I got a Roomba.Okay, maybe that's a stretch.  I will say, though, that it has been a source of unmitigated pleasure in a year where such delights were tough to come by.","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9968059659004211
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Review for:  ""iRobot Roomba 675 Robot Vacuum-Wi-Fi Connectivity, Works with Alexa, Good for Pet Hair, Carpets, Hard Floors, Self-Charging""We bought a Roomba i4 (4150) at Costco and loved it so much for its ability to clean the hardwoods & tile floors downstairs that we bought this Roomba 675 (a week later here on Amazon) for dedicated cleaning in our Florida room (330 sq. ft.), where the i4 can't reach because of a step-down.The Florida room has our cat litter boxes and also a wood stove, so there are plenty of opportunities for debris on the ceramic tile floor, such as cat hair, cat litter granules and dirt, ash & wood debris.  Daily cleaning is a must in this room and the 675 does a great job!  We have a schedule to have her run overnight.  It's nice coming down to a clean room every morning!The app is good and provides status, scheduling and feedback.  Since we have two Roombas running from the same app, we named the 675 ""Flo"" (for Florida room), and the i4 ""Rosie,"" who cleans the entire downstairs.  We'll get messages such as, ""Flo completed her job but needs to be emptied,"" or ""Flo is stuck - go help her!""  Cute and handy.  You don't have to use the app though - if WiFi is unavailable you can just use the buttons on top of the unit.Notes:1.  Long hair will occasionally get tangled around the brushes.  Cat hair is NOT a problem though - gets sucked right up!2.  Like other Roombas, move cords out of the way.3.  I clean Flo's brushes, wheels and the fine particulates filter about once a week or so.  Your mileage may vary, depending on how often you use it and how dirty the room is.4.  The 675 can sometimes have difficulty getting back up on the docking/charging station.  Not because of any technical issues with homing but rather getting the nose wheel up over the initial hump of the docking station.  I may sand down the front of the docking station to create a more gentle angle for the wheel.  The i4 does not have this issue.5.  Use Command™ strips to hold the docking station to the floor & keep it from moving.The bottom line for these Roombas:  they do clean and make a noticeable difference with how the house looks and you can get some time back from having to vacuum.  I recommend any Roomba - model 675 and higher - without hesitation.","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9880659580230713
4.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was not happy with the Roomba. I have laminate floors with several area rugs. One under the dining table, in front of the sofa, a runner at the door and in the kitchen, all in a ""great room."" It would not reliably transition from the floor to the rugs. and once on a rug it would often go into error stating it had reached a cliff. It would not cross the threshold into the bathroom transitioning from laminate to vinyl. It was frustrating to say the least. I decided to try it in my bedroom. It still could not deal with the rugs. I was determined to figure a way to get my money out of it. Ultimately I used, smaller, thinner rugs next to the bed set firmly in place using tacky putty.  It even mattered where they were positioned, the distance between rug and nightstand because of how it approached the rug. After a few adjustments of other obstacles it got hung up in, it has worked flawlessly since. It is smart, and programmable, and through the Wi-Fi  connection it tells me on my phone when it needs help or completes a job. It vacuums under the bed and running it twice a week is adequate to keep my floor spotless. I would recommend it if your floor is of one composition. I decided to try a Eufy Boost upstairs since they were on sale and boasted of large wheels and traction. That thing runs like a 4wd. It will climb your foot. It tries to climb the stainless bases of my bar stools and polishes them in the process. It has no problem with rugs or thresholds and once again, after adjusting obstacles it encounters, has worked flawlessly. It is not as smart as the Roomba and runs in a random pattern, but after a few sessions it has cleaned the floor and kept it that way. It has two options, program it to run everyday at a certain time, or on demand. Not needing it every day,  I do not mind starting it on demand when I want because it is so quiet in comparison to the Roomba. So I can be watching TV without it disturbing me. I am definitely going to buy a 3rd robot for the mudroom/laundry so all the floors are covered but it will not be a Roomba because it has thresholds and rugs.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK. I am in an interesting position where I can compare 2 of these vacuums. I previously owned a Deebot N79. It ran for about 3 years with a battery change last year. It finally stopped charging even with a new battery. So I bought a Roomba... Ok, I have 2 small, husky type dogs that blow their coat every 6 months, a cat, and laminate floors with a couple of fluffy door mats. The house is open plan but has quite a bit of furniture to negotiate. So both vacuums had the same task. The Deebot was better.1. The Roomba only has a single front brush. So bits tend to get flipped across the floor. Also when it circles, it circles on the brush side, which seems counter-intuitive2. The Roomba is noisier, quite a bit loader.3. The Roomba moves faster, tends to overrun dirt rather than always picking it up4. The Roomba sits higher. Pros and cons for this. It doesn't get stuck so often under cabinet overhangs, especially the kitchen.5. Finally, the fuzzy logic/AI that creates the 'random' path that the machine tracks around the house means the Roomba doesn't cover the whole house. This was the most frustrating part. I would have to keep relocating it to a part of the house it hadn't covered because it would become 'obsessed' with a specific part of the house. When the machine had bashed your ankles for the 5th time in the kitchen yet hadn't even got into the front room, its just irritating.Both machines would run for about 2 hours on a full charge. Both would need regular emptying, especially in shedding season. But the Deebot did a better job of cleaning and covered more area. These are both older models so it interesting to see how a newer version would cope. Also, I never used the wifi connectivity, which was available on both. I was happy to press the button when needed.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a poor, disabled college student who lacks a lot of energy most of the time to even do basic tasks, I was thinking about a roomba. I searched for ones that would work on carpet with pet hair, and this bad boy came up. I got him for black friday, and hoped I didn't just buy a dumb thing that doesn't suck anything up. I named him Gerald.I placed him on his docking port and let him charge until I let him go. I even downloaded the app to see what that was all about, and I gotta say, it's really nice. He can get tangled in cords, so you gotta make sure to keep those in spots he can't get around. He'll beep at you if he's stuck on something, but my floors are clean, and I'm happy.He has a little spinning thing that whacks the ground/dirt and brings it up to suck up, and watching him go around is kind of endearing. He is a little noisy, he's not completely silent but it's not a bother to me. He does have a small dirt container, so if you got a big place and/or mess you're gonna have to empty him a couple of times at least.It took him a bit to kind of learn that there are other places to vacuum, which then he ran low on battery and stopped, but I'm not mad. I love this already, because it's a cleaner place and we all know just being around a dirty place can make your mood bad, which gets worse if you're disabled and have a hard time just doing things in general.I honestly will recommend a robot vacuum to anybody now, but especially this one if you have carpets and/or pets, and ESPECIALLY if you're chronically ill/disabled - it makes me feel a little more autonomous in my life, and my life is a little bit cleaner.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9105350971221924
1.0 out of 5 stars,"FUNCTION 3/10: Ok, so its been 2 full years. This product simply doesn't work. It get stuck extremely easily. at least once per use, and often 4-5 times or more. (whats the point of a hands free vacuum if you have to reset it several times per use?) It even gets stuck on nothing at all, often just circling in the middle of the floor. It can't clean my living room and dining room on one charge, not due to short battery life but due to it ramming into the same wall or corner, over and over. If you have *any cords, cables, or wires dangling this will get stuck. If you have a couch *slightly too low this will get stuck. It gets stuck on my dishwasher, its gets stuck on a shoelace. I have a friend with the top tier version and I asked him if he likes his, since I've learned to loath mine. And he responded that he doesn't like it, and its been turned off for almost a year now. He just sweeps and spot mops his hardwoods on occasion. This is a WASTE OF MONEY.PRIVACY 1/10: Did you know you need to review and follow a privacy policy and terms of service for this product? But, not to worry, the terms of service and privacy policy are updated and adhered too automatically. Which means that even if you read the entire thing when you bought it, they'll simply change it later and follow a new policy. Hope no one is listening in, or mapping your apartment...APP 2/10: Terrible. Why have an app if the only options are to set when it runs, and turn it off and on? Further, it continually logs me out of the app. Like how am I going to remember a password for a vacuum clearner (a hilarious thought in itself) that I made 4 months ago and used once? I wont. So I about 5 times per year I simply have to reset my password for my vacuum cleaner. Its really crazy when it tells me I cant use the same password I've used before, or its too similar to my user name. ...my vacuum user name and password have a high security protocol I suppose.In short: DO NOT BUY. this product is a waste of money.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously disappointed with this buy & I'm not gonna lie, a little peeved at the 5 star reviews- especially from vine reviewers. I didn't get this vacuum for free. After tons of research, I settled on this vacuum, for almost $200- & that was on sale. Reviews were mostly raves and said how it was a miraclulously silent, god-tier vacuum. This is not the case. The only pro I've found yet it that it's good at cleaning hardwood floors. The cons list however, is numerous. It's seriously loud af. I turned it on & even though it was nowhere near my cat, it freaked her out so bad that she bolted. I sat watching it from the bed for a half hour & while it would ride up onto the carpet, it would spaz out less that a foot onto the carpet, spin around & go right back off it. & I don't even have shag carpet- it's a flat carpet that I bought on Amazon (For reference: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NG14P9C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_d9MaGb5B6DFTA?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1 ). Everytime it hit anything larger than a 1""x1"" piece of paper, it would spaz out, spin in circles and go back over the same space it just vacuumed. After the full ""clean everything"" cycle, it returned to it's base with none of my carpets vacuumed, but all the hardwood around them was spotless. When it sent itself back to it's home base, it kept getting caught on the trash can 3 feet from the base. I had to scoop it up and place it back on the base. If you have, oh I don't know, furniture in your house - opt for the Roomba that does floor mapping, which I thought this one did - but that's my mistake. It does not. It is random. I'll give it another week, to see if it adjusts to my carpets, but if not, I'll be returning.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband had always wanted a Roomba. Obviously I was just as intrigued as the next person with the idea of a robot vacuum, but I never saw the need. Then my husband bought one on and whim and boy, oh, boy. There is no going back for me.Does this Roomba replace a traditional vacuum in a home with three kids, three cats, and a dog? No. But does it help keep said home a whole lot cleaner? Yes!While I do still vacuum frequently, it’s not nearly as often as it used to be. Sometimes I actually vacuum WHILE the Roomba is vacuuming. We’re like a little vacuuming duo and it honestly just makes my heart happy to work alongside my little robot buddy.The Roomba won’t do any deep cleaning, so I will still suck up hair and dirt with my upright vacuum after the Roomba has finished. But it goes the other way as well. I can vacuum a room, then send out the Roomba and it picks up stuff I missed. If you don’t have animals, I think a Roomba could easily be all you need to keep your floors clean.Where the Roomba really shines is for under furniture. If you have animals that love to sleep under couches and beds, you know how hairy things can get under there. I wouldn’t vacuum under my bed nearly often enough. Who wants to be pulling out a huge bed, especially in a small space? Send in the robot! I couldn’t believe how clean the Roomba got the floor the first time I had it clean under my bed!And I love the spot clean feature! I’ve used it on small rugs, to clean up tiny bits of glass after a cup was dropped on the floor, and one of my favorite ways to use it is as a dust pan. I put the Roomba on spot mode and then I sweep toward it. So much easier and faster than sweeping everything into a dust pan.We loved scheduling the vacuum to clean at night while we slept so we could wake up to a freshly vacuumed floor. But then our dog pooped on the floor in the night. I will say that the Roomba did a fairly decent job at cleaning it up. But needless to say, we don’t do that anymore. Now I just start it first thing in the morning.My only complaint is the rotating bristle brushy thing. It started squeaking on the second day we had the Roomba. My husband has to keep greasing it, but the squeaking always comes back in a couple days. Other than that though, this thing is pure magic.

The vacuum its self is much quieter than a traditional vacuum, but what is irritating to listen to is the bot hitting all on walls and books shelfs multiple times. There is an option in the app to rate the bots performance, for I am hoping it may get smarter over time.3) The bot has a hard time finding it's base. The last few times I run the bot it has pent more than 20 mins trying to find the base. This last time the battery ran out before it could find its way home.5/6 updatedThe vacuum has still not learned not to run full force into my furniture, and has cause damage to the base of my furniture. While it does a good job cleaning, I would prefer it if stopped kicking my bookshelves and end tables.5/28 updateI dropped a star on my review because of poor customer service from iRobot. I recently moved and am not longer able to get my vacuum to connect to my phone. After trying all the troubleshooting recommendations from the iRobot help site and not having any luck I contacted customer service. It has been over a week and I have still not heard back. The vacuum does work, but I cannot set a schedule or start the vacuum from my phone only from the buttons on top of the vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.990771472454071
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this Roomba for my dad for Christmas. He lives alone in his house with a cat. He's still working full-time, so vacuuming is not a top priority.He affectionately named his Roomba ""Robert."" Robert was very easy to set-up. The app was simple to install into my dad's older iPhone, and it is very easy to navigate.We let Robert explore his new environment, and it was amazing how much junk he sucked up over a little under an hour of vacuuming!My dad lives in a ranch-style home, so Robert didn't make it down the hallway into all the bedrooms during his first voyage, but he did cover a lot of space! My dad sent me a video of him on Saturday, and he had made it all the way to the bedroom on the opposite side of the house! (My dad's house is 1300 sq. feet)Here are the pros and cons so far:Pros:1) Covers a lot of square footage during a vacuuming episode.2) Battery lasts about 1hr 20 mins, and then he goes home to rest and recharge at his dock.3) Very maneuverable! He is able to get into and out of some surprisingly small spaces. If it's quite narrow, he'll bump around a bit, but will eventually make his way back out.4) Cliff sensor! He won't fall down the stairs unless you push him. Why would you do that?! He's so cute!5) He slows down before bumping into things. And will only do so very gently.6) Noise is not bad. To me he is quieter than any other non-robot vacuum. For those of you who complain about noise, come on, he's a VACUUM!7) You can program his cleaning schedule in the app that is very easy to navigate.8) Easy to empty the canister.9) Fits under a lot of difficult to reach areas: beds, couches, dressers (if high enough).10) Does great on low-pile carpeting and climbs easily from linoleum to carpet.11) Can climb easily onto low-pile rugs.Cons:1) This is a ""random"" model, meaning he won't learn the layout of your home. He is more likely to go over the same spots a few times and not reach distant areas as frequently (but he still makes it!).2) You should empty the canister after every 1-2 vacuuming sessions, and this may be difficult to remember if he cleans while you're at work.3) He can get stuck on some rugs that have long threads (just like your normal vacuum would), and cannot climb into high-pile rugs, so he will go around them.Overall, my dad loves Robert the Roomba. No, Robert does not perform as thorough of a job as a ""human"" one, and you should still physically vacuum to get into the nooks and crannies of your home. But, the Roomba is great for those in-between vacuum jobs!","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9753378629684448

I called customer service to see if I can override this and they said no there is nothing I can do about that.  To be honest I was very shocked and disappointed as I doubt I’m the only one that has black colored areas in my carpet.  I wanted to share so everyone knows it’s limitations. I think I will return this and get my money back.","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.995965838432312
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Gift for wife.  Not sure what I expected, but it's mediocre at best. Our house has a very unique floorplan, not standard rectangular rooms and Roomba tends to get stuck in small areas and clean over and over in that spot, leaving other areas untouched.  Noise level is higher than expected, but not terrible. On tile floor, blows dog hair around more than sucking it up.  Overall I didn't expect perfection, but I expected a little more from this little guy.  Probably wouldn't buy again unless it gets a re-work.  One thing that could change my mind is maybe looking into merging with that floorplan builder app, where you use your smartphone camera to measure and map rooms, I think if that could be used to upload to the Roomba for more efficient use of it's path and time management, I'd be more likely to buy again.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never had a Roomba since we bought the very first one that came out. This was back before it would auto-dock, when the dirt catch trap was very small, when we didn't have much money, and we had full carpet in the house plus a rug in the living room on top of the carpet. We also had toddlers and much clutter. We were not very impressed with that first Roomba, and all of the things I would have changed were in fact changed with the second one, but we didn't have the money at the time to get the second one.Imagine my surprise then, upon getting this Roomba 675, at how far things have come in 15 years.The Roomba can be scheduled and goes back home to his dock when he's finished cleaning.We have replaced all our floors with laminate and only have a few area rugs.The Roomba has a larger dirt catch and a bunch of other cool features and brushes that were not on the first one.We don't have toddlers any more, and picking up everything before it comes out to vacuum is much more straightforward.Quirks of the Roomba that a person vacuuming wouldn't have-1. Sometimes it ""finishes"" a job with visible dirt still on the floor. This is because it doesn't have real eyeballs but rather uses a special algorithm to clean the floor which leaves dirt sometimes.2. Sometimes it has problems docking. The dock is pretty lightweight and easy to push around, and the docking process involves a sideways push that often just pushes it out of place. (There are non-slip pads on the bottom of the dock that don't really work. We had to use double-sided tape) When it fails to dock it goes away from the dock and casually pretends that it didn't need to dock yet. Sometimes it wanders off for a few minutes until it tries again.3. In fact when the app tells me it's docking or I tell it to dock, it usually takes another ten minutes to actually go back to the dock. Of course I could go over there and put it on the dock myself but I've been trying to see how much of life it can actually handle on its own.4. When I don't want it to vacuum a room (because it's not dirty, or I haven't picked it up, or to keep the cycle shorter by eliminating areas), the easiest way to prevent that is to spend money on an invisible wall, or do what I do and just lay a chair down in the doorway, put a laundry basket in the way, etc. Basically anything heavier than a few pounds will make it stop trying to go that way. Of course if I was vacuuming as a human, I would just choose not to go in certain areas.5. If I really want the Roomba to concentrate on a certain area, I can use the ""spot"" button, which will make it go in a spiral for a couple minutes, or I can shut it in a room, like a closet or bathroom. This is more effective than letting it roam the whole house and hoping it will stumble upon the closet and spend enough time in there to get it really clean. I find myself carrying it around, setting it in a room, shutting the door, and pressing the ""clean"" button. It will vacuum for about 10-20 minutes depending on the size of the room and then declare itself finished with an audible tone and a push notification from the app.Some of the Roombas learn the house and draw a map so they aren't forever wandering, but this one does not have that capability. Set up was very straightforward.Pros: My floors are cleaner than they've ever been, first because it really is good at picking up dirt, and second because it's willing to vacuum every day or multiple times a day, whereas I'm not (lol). I'm actually happy to walk barefoot, and I'm not sad when the dog sheds because I know the Roomba will take care of it.Cons:1. My dog is scared of it. Frankly she's scared of a lot of things but since this goes for such a long time (60 minutes) I feel bad that she won't be anywhere near it for that time, compared to when I vacuum for only 15 minutes or so to cover the same areas.2. It IS loud, and since our family often has at least one person home, it's going to be hard to find a time that isn't annoying to someone to vacuum.3. My small area rugs are just wrong for the Roomba to handle. They are too easy to vacuum up, or too thick to go up on, or something. Of course when I vacuum I just avoid them or pick them up, but it's a bit of a chore to pick them up every day.4. You do need to be aware of cords and small debris. The sock it tried to pick up just jammed it a little so I had to rescue it, but I think it could pull lamps down etc. So you'll need to check your house for areas you can block with furniture, or move the cords away.As with any vacuum you'll want to keep it very clean and hair free, so that it works better. There's a cleaning kit available with extra filters and everything you'll need to keep it in top condition.Overall I'm super happy so far. I was very surprised by the way it has changed and the effectiveness of its cleaning power. I'll still keep a regular vacuum for certain applications, but the Roomba will definitely be used much more.","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2018",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9989293217658997
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to wait a few months to write my review so that I could be as thorough as possible. I currently have a love hate relationship with our Roomba. Here are the pros...you can run it with Alexa, you can run it when you aren’t home, if you have a large, single level house, it can do a lot of work for you, while you do something else. However, it has a lot of cons, in my opinion. As far as I can tell, it hasn’t learned our house that well yet. It constantly bumps into things and the route it takes seems pretty random. It will eventually get almost everything off the floor after running for a good two hours, but it has to run for a while to get everything and it will go through the same room multiple times, instead of doing one room to completion and then moving on to the next room. It also frequently shoots dust/dirt/food away from itself instead of sucking it up, which is infuriating if your doing a spot clean. It also has a very small canister for storing dirt and debris, so you have to clean it every time you use it.  I’ve found that it is very loud. I have friends who run theirs at night while they sleep, but ours is too loud for that, it keeps me awake if I do that. Also, you have to make sure nothing is on the ground (chords, shoes). I can’t tell you how many times ours has gotten messed up because it got ahold of our phone chord. Mine also has this one spot under the couch and next to an end table that it gets stuck almost every day (again, it doesn’t seem to be learning my house). So, if you do run it when you aren’t home, you often have to go searching for it (dead) in your house somewhere and take it back to the base to charge it.  Lastly, we have very thick carpet in our kids’ bedrooms. Our Roomba will get to the entrance of the kids bedrooms, bump into the carpet and turn around and not go in their rooms.  This has ended up working in our favor, because the kids leave their stuff everywhere and it would probably ruin the Roomba, but I didn’t expect that to happen when I purchased it.Overall, I’m glad we have it, because our house is too big and has too much dust/hair/food on the floor for me to vacuum the whole house every day.  However, there are several areas where it could be improved.","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9895771145820618
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently, in an effort to help my family's issues with minor allergies, we completely remodeled out main levels flooring, replacing mixed laminate, linoleum, and carpet all with thick vinyl plank and a few select washable rugs. We then picked one of these up to run daily to pick up any dust, dirt, pet hair, dander, or anything else it found.  We wer very deliberate before running it of course and gave the house a thorough post construction deep clean, vacuuming the entire place, followed but a dust mop, followed by steam mopping the entire house. We have 2 dogs, and a household with 1 half ball man and 3 girls.First, the hair. omg, so. much. hair. It picks it up so there's that, and it then proceeds to rap around every moving part of the roomba and within a couple days it needs to be cleaned out before the different parts begin to lock up. Today it was happily bouncing around, the gimpy little yellow flipper brush completely dead stuck(and warm to the touch). No warning or anything, just jammed up.Suction strength. Between the suction and the rollers it is able to do ok, picking up all the dog hair and a fair bit of the small bits of dust/drywall/sawdust, but randomly misses stuff like small 1/2"" pieces of paper from the kids. I should have done a bit more research at this point and chose at least a model E5 or higher for this reason. The 675 is better suited for carpet/rugs than it is hard surfaces.My bigger complaint, is how often it gets stuck. It's just barely over a 50% successful run rate at this point, often stopping on a low pile rug stating it's on a cliff or rammed itself upwards on a table leg and got hung up. I don't get it.If we ever purchase another vac like this I will pay the money for a higher end unit that has better suction and actively plots it's course, listening/watching this thing bounce off everything in the house for an hour and a half is a bit ridiculous especially when some rooms get cleaned  3 times and other areas get missed.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9986469149589539
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this a few weeks ago after my Neato gave out.PROS-The app and wifi connection is awesome. I can tell my alexa to turn it on or off etc.- It doesn't get stuck or caught on things nearly as often as my neato did. My neato was shaped like the letter D. So it was bound to get stuck a lot. This little guy is round and can work his way out of most situations.- It picks up a TON of lint and trash off the floor. We don't have dogs but we do have 2 kids. And my husband is a mechanic that loves to ride 4 wheelers in mud. My daughter and I both have long hair that falls out everywhere. And my 1 year old son drops food like no bodys business.  So my floor always needs a good vacuuming. This does the job. I can run my regular vacuum over the floors and then turn this on and it still gives me a full bin of lint and dirt.CONS.. - The biggest drawback for me is the fact that my house is pretty open concept. It cleans pretty sporadically and does miss some areas. Next time I will be getting the roomba that you can set boundaries for. So that you can pick one room for it to clean at a time. For example my kitchen has 4 door ways (weird I know). Honestly I just need that room cleaned most the time when I turn it on but I can't block it in there because it would be nearly impossible with all the ways for it to escape. I have read that Irobot sells something for this so I'm going to look into it. But keep in mind that if your home is open concept it DOES clean pretty sporadically. I usually put it in a room and shut the door. It cleans the room and does a great job. When it's done it plays its little jingle and a notification is sent to my phone. I go and move it to another area. Kind of annoying but better than having to lug my vacuum around to do the whole house.- As I said before, my daughter and I both have long hair and we shed a lot. So every week I am cutting hair out of all the nooks and crannies on this thing. Hair is wrapped around everything! I know it is probably wrapped around the wheels too.. as that is what happened with my neato. So I know I will eventually have to take it apart and cut hair out of all the hard to reach places such as the axels. I'm really not sure if the more expensive ones would do a better job or not. This might just be a curse that we long haired girls are forever doomed to.Overall I am happy with this purchase. We named our vacuum Sir Cleans-a-lot. Hes part of the family and we love him.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9956836104393005
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a Roomba 675 and used it for a month.  Because of a bunch of issues, I decided to return it.  Today, I received my Eufy, and I now can say for sure that the Roomba is a poor product.1.  The Roomba was always stopping and giving me annoying error codes, even though nothing was wrong2.  The Eufy is a flatter device, and doesn't get stuck like the Roomba did.. constantly3.  The Roomba side brush requires screws to secure them.  When I changed the brush, the screw never fit correctly and the brush would fall off (two brushes, two screws)4.  The Eufy has TWO side brushes, making it much more efficient5.  The Roomba would prevent me from watching TV, it was so noisy.  The Eufy isn't silent, but its nothing compared to the Roomba.6.  Even though I used the Roomba yesterday, the dirt cup of my Eufy was completely full today -- meaning, the Roomba wasn't really doing a very good job7.  The Eufy has many more features, including being able to direct the unit without picking it up, and changing the intensity of the cleaning8.  The Eufy is cheaper.  I'm anticipating that no unit will last forever since I use it twice a day... so a lower cost unit with better capabilities is very appealing9.  The Roomba wasn't great about docking. Most times I'd have to manually dock it.  Eufy docks every time so farI will update as I use the eufy!","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9958545565605164
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I bought this roomba on prime day for 25% off which was a great deal!Pros: the roomba picks up pretty much everything, eventually. It does sometimes take a while to get the entire floor but it will eventually get everything just be patient. Easy to empty and change the liner. Also very convenient that it will clean while you sit on the couch!Cons- if the roomba gets stuck on something (cords, a loose sock, ect.) it will make a very loud beeping and flash a warning sign. I cannot leave it running while I am not home because of this. It is also quite loud, if I am watching TV I have to turn the TVs volume up to hear over the roomba. I have also had some issues connecting the app. Every time I try it says there is not a roomba within range even though I am right next to it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give zero stars I would. As it is, I am just waiting for it to die, be sent repeatedly for that nifty warranty I bought (don't even ask), have it come back the same and finally get reimbursed for a new machine.It gets stuck in the same places every single day. It often gets stuck in the same place three times in one session, which is when I dock it and give up.It consistently becomes wedged under cabinets. The molding strip around the fireplace baffles it completely. Despite putting up barriers, it finds a way to get around and get stuck under the sofa or the bar cart or the rocking chair runners.On good days you can dock it in one try. On miracle days it actually docks itself. But usually it runs into the docking station, shoves it around and then gets tangled in the docking station cord.I hate it. Before this, I had a succession on Neato robo-vacs, which often had mechanical problems but actually cleaned the floors without the drama.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been waiting and hoping to be able to afford a Roomba when I saw this model at Black Friday prices.  I couldn't wait to get it and was excited to ""hook"" it up.  I found the right spot, put it on the base for the recommended time, pressed the cleaning button and left the bedroom when it started to move.  After about one half hour I went down the hall to see why it had not come into the dining or living rooms, and then I saw it.  Practically spinning in place, in circles, not sweeping around the furniture and the worst part was, it was still pretty much where I left it.  I decided that I needed to learn more about how to use it and took the manual out.  After review, I did not learn anything new.  I am a caregiver for my ill husband and was trying to make my life a little bit easier but this was not what I expected.  I think I reached out to a Roomba website for help, I really can't remember right now with so many things going on this Christmas season.  I will take up with this again after the holidays to try to figure out what is wrong.  Fellow Amazon reviewers told me that my model was not ""geared"" to switch rooms and would need to be physically moved.  Plus, this model will not return it self to base.  In my case, this will be more work than I wanted.  It makes me sad that I did not purchase the 900 series, which I am told has the capabilities I am looking for.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"We have a fairly large two story house and vacuuming takes a significant amount of time.  Thus, for Black Friday deals we decided to give this guy a try.  Spending 45+ minutes to vacuum each week is time we really would like back. This Roomba was $100 off with a money back guarantee so if it didn't work we were going to return it.The setup was easy.  You download the app and follow the instructions to connect it to your home network.  It didn't come fully charged but was fairly close.  In about 30+ minutes it was done.The app is fairly useless other than telling the Roomba to go vacuum or to return to the dock. For this model you have no other control of the unit.  The app is more of a message device.  It will tell you how much battery power is left, if the Roomba gets stuck and needs help, or if it's charging and docked. You can schedule automatic cleaning sessions with the app but realize it may not return back to the dock correctly.  You will need to verify it made it home after each session either visually or by looking at the app.After a couple weeks with a fair amount of use here is our verdict:This unit is a time saver without question.  It just requires some babysitting.  Do NOT expect for it run off in the distance, perform perfectly, get every section of the floor, then return home and sleep. It WILL get stuck and it's highly possible it won't work on some area rugs (the design patterns and cliff sensors appear to have trouble with a couple of ours), and unless you Roomba can get near the docking station by accident it won't dock before the battery dies.  Ours has a difficult time getting out of a couple rooms once it finds it's way into these rooms.The vacuuming and movement is almost random.  It does not realize where it's been so expect it to cover some areas numerous times.  It's brain does start to realize when it hits items frequently and is in confined spaces or under and around tables and chairs.  The pattern of random movement will then change. For example it can follow a wall or chair and circle around the perimeter when it thinks one is near.  Still, it doesn't know the placement of things in your house, the size or shape, so don't expect it to remember their location at all.  It will just bounce around and follow edges with the hope it eventually covers the entire area. Sadly however it won't normally unless you close the area/room off so it can't accidentally leave.  Lastly, strings, hair, etc. will get caught in the roller.  You will need to clean it regularly and be careful with what's on the floor just as you would with your own vacuum. Our daughters bed-skirt has a ruffle which was caught once as we didn't realize a small section was starting to come loose.After numerous times using the Roomba we have figured out how to make it successful for our home.  First, when away on errands we will have it run with the hopes it returns to dock.  If not we replace it when we get home. Second, we don't use it at night as it's loud, but instead while home.  We will place it in an area we want cleaned and close off doors to keep it there.  (We can see where the accessories to create borders would be highly useful.)  Third, areas such as the kitchen, living room and halls will need to be done several times, and you will still need to pull out the master vacuum to reach some difficult locations. We just let the unit run around and do it's business.  After about two or three jobs the area is clean. Since our house has a light colored tile so we can tell how well it's done and if necessary manually place it around to help finish a job.  Fourth, it does vacuum carpet very well.  Our second floor is all carpet with stairs and after having the unit perform two jobs the upstairs is complete. Since we keep the dock on the first floor we just carry it up and down the stairs.Verdict:  If you don't have crazy expectations and are willing to do some periodic babysitting then a robot vacuum is a clear time saver, especially with a big house such as ours. If you are a clean freak that wants everything done perfectly each time it leaves the dock then stay away. It won't meet your requirements.","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9891873598098755
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sitting here on Sunday, moved to finally write this review. The robot is great in some ways ... we vacuum less than we used to. But three times in an hour today it has bleeped at me, and sent me a notification, because it has gotten stuck on the corner of some rug, or between the legs of the dining room chairs, or choked on a cat toy, or gone over the threshold into some room it can't get out of.Maybe one time in 100 has this robot actually completed a job without getting stuck somewhere. This is not some crazy house. This is a normal house, on a fairly open plan, actually, with normal amounts of things in it. If I wasn't stuck at home for the pandemic, this robot would not be worth it. I'm here so I can get up, move it an inch, and hit the button twice a day. But if you're thinking that this thing can do your vacuuming while you're not around, think again.This is our first iRobot, we've had it for three months. We've had Deebots before; they're not better. This is a robot problem, not an iRobot problem.UPDATE: now it broke, four months in. One of the drive wheels won't spin. After 3 weeks I'm still waiting for the replacement part from Roomba, which they shipped via ""UPS Mail Innovations,"" i.e. that service where UPS drops it off at a USPS location.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a 650 model for years which can be scheduled on the device. Now, for model 675 this function need to be done with its APP. The APP has an updated version and asked me to download. Alas! When I open the updated APP, I was asked to login. The APP is so poorly designed that it cannot even recognize the very iPhone which has a previous version and is in login status. Moreover, unlike many APP, in case the user forgot the user name and password, there are ways to restore the user name and reset password. This APP is so designed that you can only reset the password. But without the user name, the password cannot be reset. When trying to create a new account, I was told that this device has been registered with another user name. So, I am stuck. The only option for me is to let the Roomba run the way it was first set up when I bought it. As a result, I deleted this useless APP. It is amazing that the engineers who work on AI and robot can design a robot that is so user unfriendly!BTW, as mentioned above, when I used a different email to register, I got an error message.

   I'll get right into. I personally think the pathing algorithm is terrible. When it starts, it consistently ends up in the cleaning every room except for the room it starts in. It also seems to prefer smaller spaces, as it cleans my laundry room and the guest bathroom about 5-6 times every run and has a hard time covering large spaces as it tends to leave the larger areas before completing.Also, it's unable at docking itself (video included) It refuses to dock on its own and will repeat this process 5-6 times until you're fed up at watching it and dock it yourself.Lastly, it really just pushes a lot of dirt around then blows it away when it turns around with it's vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.99924635887146
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have liked to have written an amazing review about this Roomba, but alas it came in a damaged (as in crushed) shipping box, with evidence that it was NOT a new item (broken seals inside). This crushed box was then shipped to me inside a regular larger box to hide the damage. So, what did I find inside? A dead Robot. No amount of charging would wake the poor thing. It actually looked ok, but obviously something had gone quite wrong. It was dead. I did inspect it carefully and these are the things you may be interested in: It has only one side brush - I thought this was odd for a floor vacuum, but clearly there is not meant to be another one, so it wasn't just missing. It seems to have extra sensors so it won't fall down the stairs - I assume that is what they were for, since I was never able to test it. It has two main brushes that should work in tandem with one another. The Dust bin is regular in size but then there is a weird half cone shaped filter inside of it that takes up a lot of space, so if you could use it there is lots less room for it to actually collect dust. meaning you would have to empty it more often. It does come with a charging dock and cord, it comes with an extra cone filter. It does NOT come with a remote. Since it was DOA that's all I can tell you. so Here are my assumed pros and cons:Pro:it looks nicedual main brushesextra filterdocking stationCons:No remoteonly one side brushfilter takes up a lot of bin spacedocking station power cord must come out only on the right, no option to direct it to the left","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9989544153213501

Mr. Worldwide literally has one job, and he just can't seem to accomplish it. I wish we had returned this when we had the chance. Besides the fact that it has to be perfectly place in order to align with the docking station to charge- it just doesn't pick up dirt. It will suck up a doggie pee pad, and pull an iphone charger out of the wall no problem, but the smallest pieces of dust or debris on the floor, he will simply push around or circle them before going back to his home (which is a huge achievement in itself).  We run this on occasion for maybe some psychological satisfaction, or the thought that maybe it will somehow make our floors look cleaner but like others have said, save your money and just buy a compact vacuum, or different model, maybe there are some out there that work?

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Understand there's not really much ""robotic"" about this vacuum.  It just randomly ping-pongs around and if you have several rooms it may spend hours in one room never to touch another.  I had a Neato brand years ago that had lidar and would start at one end of the room and cross precisely over to the other side, make a perfect 180 and come back to vacuum the next strip.  The carpet looked like a freshly plowed farm field.  The Roomba will not do that.I'm not sure what the point of the wifi/phone interface is other than to set a schedule - it wont do anything more than that, plus stop the vacuum if you want it stopped.  The ""return to base"" has never worked for me.Now, all that said, it generally does what it's supposed to do.  If you sit and watch it, you'll be struck by how dumb it is.  If you just set it to start after you leave for work. you'll come back to find the dustbin full, so there is a point to it.  It won't supplant a regular vacuuming, but it will help keep your house clean.  Seems to work fine on hardwood floors and makes the transition to carpet just fine, where it seems to excel.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The iRobot 675 has changed my life. I’m a mom to 4 young children living in a 1880 square foot house on a large wooded lot. My kids are outside A LOT and track in all kinds of dirt, mud, leaves, grass, etc. My husband, while I love him, is also kind of a mess and has a bad habit of not wiping his shoes and bringing in a ton of sawdust from his projects. On top of all of that, add in the fact that children under 7 really don’t know how to eat properly and drop about seven thousand crumbs per meal per child. Our floors, wood, tile, and carpet, have been a disaster for years.Enter the Roomba. I have been eyeing this little piece of wizardry for years and wondering if this could be the tool that could change my life. I swept and vacuumed (with a Dyson DC33) multiple times a day. I was constantly telling guests, “hey sorry about the floor but I think we’re just gross and I can never get on top of it”. Well, after finally biting the bullet I regret that I didn’t buy a Roomba years ago. I don’t have to apologize to guests and I can finally walk barefoot in my house without having 100 tiny crumbs attaching to the bottom of my feet. I love this thing more than I have ever loved any appliance or cleaning tool I have every owned.About half of our home is our 2 living areas, dining, kitchen, and mud room. The other half are 4 bedrooms and two bathrooms. I have a baby gate dividing the two halves which acts as a barrier that the Roomba can’t get through. I really like having that barrier and if I didn’t use that baby gate I probably would have gone with the 690 for the virtual wall but I don’t see a purpose for it for us. I run the Roomba every night in our living/eating/kitchen area after we pick up the toys and straighten up the house. This is like magic. I always WANT to have things picked up and put away but I didn’t always do that before the Roomba because we are TIRED. But I love running the Roomba so much that since we have owned this thing we have cleaned up every night since we have owned it. Magic. I run the Roomba in the bedroom/bathroom areas 2-3 times a week in our house. Our kids are a little afraid of it (I want them to be, I don’t want them to touch it, and I may have told them it will bite them) and it does make noise so between all of our napping and sleeping I don’t have as much time to run it back there. I don’t mind though, because the bedrooms do not get nearly as dirty as our living areas.The things I wish I would have known before purchasing:- It really does clean all of the floor. It picks everything up. The crumbs and leaves are gone. It doesn’t miss any part of the floor. I was afraid it would kind of get half of the floor and not the other half because it isn’t as intelligent as the higher trim lines of the Roomba. I was wrong. This thing is amazing. I heard from someone else that you shouldn’t watch the Roomba because it will just drive you crazy. This is totally true. I watch it and question every move it makes. Why did it roll right past that crumb? Why is it spending 20 minutes under that couch? Just don’t watch it! It so nice to lay in bed at night, tell it to clean from my smart phone, go to sleep, and wake up in the morning to spotless floors!- I have needed to clean out the dust bin after every cleaning. I read a lot of reviews that said once you get into the swing of things with your Roomba you only need to clean out the dust bin once or twice a week. That hasn’t been true for us. I’m telling you, we are gross. So if your kids are especially messy or you have really messy pets or track in a lot from being outside that might just be your reality. But that’s fine with me because emptying the dustbin is a lot easier than vacuuming my own floors!- It charges really quickly. I thought I’d be waiting half a day for a charge. Not so. Ours charges within an hour which is nice because I like to charge in between doing both halves of my house. With as dirty as our floors get I don’t think the Roomba could do the entire 1880 square feet on one charge.- Unless you really, really want the features the higher end Roombas provide you really shouldn’t look at this vacuum as a cheap item. The technology in this thing is awesome (or at least I think it is, I’m not really super techy). This is a great robot that does an amazing job and seems very durable.- It does make noise. My mother in law commented that she was surprised it made noise. It’s a vacuum.- It has changed my life. I am excited to clean my house. I am excited to pick up toys. Nothing has ever made me happier about cleaning. This thing is the real deal. I wake up to clean floors every morning and I didn’t do any of the work.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"When I purchase something like this item, I hold off submitting a review until I’ve had the chance to use it for a duration, usually a year. I read a funny review online yesterday, about Roomba, which reminded me I needed to do a Roomba review myself. Yesterday’s reviewer gave a one star review, and returned his purchase, stating his Roomba acted like it was drunk, wandered aimlessly, ran into the same item repeatedly, was unable to locate its charging station, and would send him messages saying things like “Help Roomba is stuck on a cliff!”, only to come home and find Roomba sitting in the middle of the kitchen, no cliffs in sight. I read this review, and every thing he says is straight up gospel, even the ridiculous cliff SOS, all 100% true. We call our vacuum Roombo, men vacuum too, unfortunately Roombo, like Roomba, is not the intuitive robotic vacuum I thought I was getting. Roomba and the word intuitive have never met. So why three stars? Because I have 3 dogs and 2 cats living in my home, and even if Roomba spins in a circle in a single room, she is a hair catcher like nobody’s business. Packed full of dirt and hair after every single cycle. That’s dirt and hair I don’t have to worry about. So even if I have to send out a search party to find her occasionally, I’ll keep her. So far, she’s been low maintenance, clean her occasionally and she off to find another cliff to fall off of.","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2019",142 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9971960186958313

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My new rescue dog is a major shedder and I find hair everywhere so I decided to try a robot vacuum with a gift certificate I received for x-mas. I read review after review and for the price point I bought the Deik. It also had great reviews but it was horrible. Even the return process was bad but I won't get into all that. The Roomba is amazing. The install was instant. Adding it to my wi-fi and Alexa was so easy. I like the simple clean or dock mode. No special cleaning modes to choose just clean or sleep. The Deik got stuck everywhere, chair legs, throw rugs, corners, etc. etc. Roomba is like a 4-wheel drive compared to the Deik. You can see it as it lifts itself up to get over obstacles. It is so much faster and doesn't seem to go in circles like the Deik. Roomba on it's first day covered every room. Every 15 minutes I would find it and empty the container which was always packed full of hair and even dirt which I didn't think I had. It pushes obstacles like shoes and cords out of its way. The only thing it sucked up was a couple of socks and a dryer sheet but it stops and notifies you on your phone that it has a problem. I didn't go around and pick up cords, dog toys, etc. It seems to just roll over them or push them out of the way. It hugs corners and turns very well. The dogs could care less. It bumps into my big dog and he doesn't even move. My little dog who goes outside when I'm vacuuming could care less about the Roomba. Compared to the Deik it is also very quiet. Somewhere I saw it compared to a microwave and that's pretty accurate.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is definitely a must buy product for anyone who absolutely hates vacuuming.... like me.On the whole, the Roomba 675 is doing it's job. It gets under my couch and beneath furniture that I am honestly way too lazy to sweep and vacuum myself.It is important to remember, however, that this does not replace a real-life human doing the sweeping and vacuuming. It's much slower, it can't see spots it may have missed, and it bumps into more furniture and walls than a drunk freshman undergraduate.When I have guests coming over, I run the Roomba while I'm away and the do a final sweep/vacuum before they arrive. I'd say the Roomba picks up 85% of the dirt, dust, and other crud on my hardwood and area carpets.This unit is a bit loud. Watching TV, talking on the phone, or having a conversation is a bit tough with the Roomba buzzing around the house and the dust bin is a bit small.End of the day, if you can spare the cash and you'd prefer to not vacuum or sweep daily/weekly, this is 100% the product for you.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The iRobot vacuum works well.However, docking is very unreliable. In fact, it's so unreliable that I must give the product only 1 star.If I put the docking station next to a wall, the iRobot seems to get confused (by signal reflection from the wall?), that it would dock then leave and go search somewhere else. It's almost as if it were saying ""hey that's not the right docking station.""If I put the docking station in the middle of the floor it would dock correctly, but only if the docking station is glued to the floor! (Otherwise the docking station gets pushed around, again confusing the iRobot.) Holding the docking station with my hand has the same effect as putting it against the wall - confusing the iRobot.Worse: when the iRobot is confused, even manaully putting it on top of the docking station won't cause it to charge. The only way around is the unplug and re-plug the power to the docking station.On average, it takes me about half dozen tries to get it to charge.I returned the original unit for an exchange, thinking it was a one-off defect. Alas, the replacement unit wasn't any better.I am a long time iRobot user. I can tell you the older models don't have this defect.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: Decided to return the product.  Noticed various scratches on my newly refinished hardwood floors which was basically the last straw.  There are a few metal pieces on the bottom of the device which I imagine are the culprit.  If you own wood floors then you know that you can't have anything metal coming in contact with your floors and sliding or dragging or you're going to get scratches.  iRobot is the most well known company in this space, but their Roomba product is really not good, still has a ton of issues 10 years later.  I signed up for Consumer Reports as a way to figure out which vacuum to purchase instead of the Roomba.  Ended up buying the Eufy RoboVac 30 for $269.  Rated #3/36 robotic vacuums tested.  Top 2 were above $600, which is why I landed on #3.Keeps vacuuming the same areas over and over and doesn't vacuum whole rooms.  The lack of mapping seems to be a big hold back and I'm wishing I bought a product that mapped smarter and I could check to see which areas were cleaned and which weren't.  It picks up light dust, but has trouble with bigger pieces of dirt.  Will go over the bigger pieces multiple times and not pick them up.

Instead of ramming into something at full force, it slows down a lot and will do a gentle bump. This seems to keep the vacuum from getting stuck, which can get a bit annoying at times.I have a dog who sheds quite a bit. This has no problem getting all her fur.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good vacuum to get for a small-midsize apartment. It really does get almost everywhere with the exception of furniture it cannot fit under. It can go over chords, however, for the sake of your motor and battery I suggest you use chord covers for any chords running across the floor or get the really tiny command hooks to help lift chords up off the ground around your computer or tv area, you can easily find a 40 pack of them.When I first started using it I had to clean the dust bin out 3 times during cleaning, it will not tell you when it is full. So I just usually run it while I am home cooking and cleaning and every 30 minutes just empty it (totalling 3 times). I have two dogs and letting this thing go daily is probably going to rescue my carpet from all of the pet hair. It is a bit noisy but I find it is about as loud as an RC car (the bigger ones). One dog fears it after trying to use it as a pillow and getting an alarming wakeup call. Setup can be a B had issues with that (some of which was user error, could not remember my wifi password). It is apparently not uncommon for the app to sort of lock up on the final setup page where it says ""connecting roomba to wi-fi"" (or something to that effect) if that happens completely exit app then reopen, it should be discoverable when you reopen the app and setup should be complete. It is a toss-up whether it will dock itself or not. This bothers me none because it usually is fairly easy to find in my 850sqft apt. and I have no qualms with letting the battery discharge completely. It did have issues with a rug that was raised at the edge because someone in our household drags their feet but I resolved this issue.It may sometime run over a dark part of the floor and think it's a cliff it needs rescuing from.This thing probably needs more babysitting than you were expecting but less work than a regular vacuum. It's really a good model to get without breaking the bank if you have less than 1000 sqft of living space. Once you pass 1200 sqft you are probably going to have to manually make it clean again once recharged. Which is honestly just a push of a button and not a big deal to me if I do ever need it to go another round.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.994249165058136

But it never, ever, ever completes a job without getting stuck on something, no matter how hard I try to clear all obstacles from the floor. Whatever it gets stuck on, the next time I vacuum I make sure to clear that obstacle, and it just finds something else. It's frustrating because there's nothing I can do about it until I get home 9-10 hours later. And the app is really, really slow; it seems to take forever to connect, and sometimes won't connect at all.In addition, the thing never -- and I mean never -- finds its way back to the dock at the end of a cleaning cycle. I noticed this when running it while I'm home. When the ""DOCK"" light starts to flash, instead of moving toward the dock it moves itself as far away from the dock as possible, always in the wrong direction, circles around the same space over and over again, always turning the wrong way so it can't get out, until the battery dies.

The sensor that makes this product ""smart"" at detecting extra dirty areas is also the sensor that makes it automatically shut off if it encounters a ledge. And because my area rug is black, it thinks it's about to fall into a black hole and shuts off.- Compared to a cheaper competitor's product, the Roomba costs about $100 more and does the same quality job. There's no ""better"" that comes with the extra $100 that you would expect.- This Roomba is a BRUTE. It's very ""heavy handed"" and hits things quite hard before it changes course. The cheaper product I owned by one of the iRobot competitors was much more gentle with walls/barriers.- All robot vacuums are loud but this Roomba is a little louder than others. Maybe it's because of power of the engine that smashes it into things so hard?OVERALL: Good quality product that is made well and works well.

Also, I named her Monica (from friends) so I reference ""her"" and ""she"".I've had this vacuum almost 2 weeks and would not recommend it. I had higher hopes for an iRobot vacuum, the original robot vacuum. I choose this one after hours of research and based on the Amazon reviews. It was a top rated vacuum on multiple lists,  especially for pet hair but I'm starting to think they just paid there way onto the lists. I wanted a vacuum that could work on both hard floor and carpet and was good with pet hair, highly rated and didn't break the bank. I was hoping this was the one...First, this vacuum leaves hair on the edge of my rug when transitioning from hard floor to rug. I did not have this problem with enfy. For reference, I have 3 dogs, one that always sheds and two huskies (its shedding season).There is no way to control the vacuum. Enfy came with a remote control. I thought maybe the app would allow me to move her to a different part of the house if needed but there is no option. If I'm working in my office and she comes in, I have no way of getting her out without picking her up and moving her.The vacuum is loud and bumps into everything!She doesn't always finds her way back to the docking station on her own. I've had to dock her a few times in the less than 10 days she has run. This was very rarely a problem with enfy.One time she docked herself but she didn't charge! I usually empty the bin daily but that day I didn't. So she didn't run as scheduled due to no battery.The bin is always full so she seems to have good suction. I don't know how I feel about the brush yet. The bristles clump together a lot so I worry if not probably cleaned everytime, this could be an issue. Pictures are from today but I spent 15 minutes cleaning her yesterday, including brushing her bristles to separate them.Also, they don't provide any cleaning tools. Luckily I have my tool from enfy still I use.Overall, she gets the job done for the most part, but she needs a lot of supervision, maintenance and I still have to clean hair she leaves behind around the rug (see pictures). She does have a good battery. She ran over 2 hours today (see pictures). If I could go back, I would just buy the cheap eufy vacuum again.Update: I've decided to return it. The whole point was to not have to see dog hair everyday, however, my rug edges always had clumps of dog hair. Going back to Eufy which never had this problem.","Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2021",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9974521994590759

It gets stuck on the air vents, a yoga mat, door threshold (which is small) and often doesn't even make it into the other rooms!  There are no controls, so if you spill flour in the kitchen?  You have to get it (not fun picking it up with old knees and a bad back) carry it in and put it on the spot.  Again, not fun with old joints!  How hard is it to put in a remote control?  Oh, and that flour?  It doesn't pick it up off of hard wood floors....so, while it sucks...it doesn't suck!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife wanted one of these, so I finally went all in with this model. I really thought that it was going to be one of those gadgets you get and it quickly becomes just another thing sitting around the house. It works mostly well, with some caveats. If you are looking to purchase this product or a similar one, I recommend you read on and get lots of advice on which one to get.We named our Donald, because it wanders around aimlessly making lots of noise, and it sucks. That said, it does a surprisingly good job. You have to run it every day. It is truly dumb, and has no memory of where it has been. Some days it vacuums some areas multiple times while missing other areas entirely. But if you let it run every day, it does eventually get around to it. I can put up with the noise for about 30 minutes at a time.Some details about my house: I have a small house: about 1100 sq ft. I have fake hardwood floors. I have a short hair dog and a short hair cat, who both shed more than one would expect. I have no carpets. There are some door jams that Donald successfully navigates. I have a loft area and have let Donald wander around up there. He is smart enough to not throw himself down the stairs. When I want him to clean the loft, I just grab the handle and carry him up the stairs and let him loose. When I am tired of listening to his noise, I carry him down stairs, press the docking button and eventually he finds his way home.One thing I was worried about was where to put the docking station. A lot of the models I read about need a large open area for docking. I have a small house and don't have any place with 4 ft of space around it. I do have this spot under the stairs to the loft area.  It usually docks just fine. You can see in the picture.It picks up a lot of dirt and pet hair. Cleaning it out at the end of the session is disgusting, but not more so than other bagless systems. The rollers and brushes get clogged up with pet hair and need to be manually removed and have all the hair picked out and then put back in every few days. This is easy to do, but even more disgusting. Oh well, we love our pets.Setting it up and getting the app installed and connected wasn't terribly difficult. For some reason, the second day the app couldn't connect, and getting it reconnected was a pain. However, you don't really need the app. Pressing the buttons on top of the device work just fine for the basic functions you use every day.To get 5 stars Donald would have to be smarter about where he goes and where he's been and less disgusting to clean out.","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2019",10 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.8885968327522278

Even with a hypo-allergenic dog and only one child, my floors get dirty daily; the dog's fur is velcro for leaves and pollen-y tassels that fall from trees, the child's shoes somehow end up on every surface imaginable, and crumbs are just a fact of life.  I'd recruit the kid's help but she's not yet big enough to do the job well.A couple years ago I tried to get a cheaper robot vacuum instead of spending the extra $ on a roomba, but ended up disappointed and frustrated with how much I had to ""rescue"" the vacuum.  It didn't perform any better than I did, so I eventually threw it away.Enter corona quarantine:  we are in our house 24/7 whereas before we were here to sleep and maybe 4-5 waking hours. Those extra waking hours walking across the floors magnified the problem: I realized I was spending at least 30 minutes per day trying to keep the floors clean, and not doing a great job as I have arthritis and bending is difficult.  I caved.  I need help, and decided to give robot vacuums another shot.  After extensive research and seeing the affordable price on Amazon, I ordered this Roomba and figured if it had performance issues like the last one I could just return it.It arrived and I could tell right away that the quality of the materials was superior to the previous vacuum - the wheels alone are like monster truck wheels compared to the previous one's toy-like wheels.  But did it REALLY perform any better?Yes. yes. yes. If I could marry this vacuum, I would. It cleaned my floors so well, I had to empty the canister twice on  the first run.

The Roomba actually picks up that as well so put flour stays and looks clean.You do have to be sure charger cords etc are up off the floor or it will tangle in them. And.. as others have commented we are living proof that the Roomba will smear dog poop around.  We had a sick pup that had an accident but fortunately we discovered it soon after the vacuum started to go so it was a mess but mostly limited to the Roomba itself. Which,by the way, was easy to disassemble and clean.After watching ours run for a bit our friends also bought the same one and couldn’t be happier. I thought it was kind of noisy until my daughter pulled out the stand up vacuum and I realized the Roomba is way quieter. Definitely glad we bought it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This worked ok for the first month, but it’s never been the same since. We’ve cleaned the sensors, bushes, etc. replaced all the replaceable parts multiple times and done all the maintenance suggested by the app. It just never works the same again, and it wasn’t THAT great to begin with. Poor suction, constantly getting stuck, it can’t clean anything black (rugs, etc). It is even scared of the natural coloration of our wood floors sometimes! Plus there are problems with the design: there’s only one side with a sweeper brush so half the area it covers doesn’t get cleaned, and the programming on the robot is not great. It will vacuum the same spot for hours. Now after 6 months of use, it refuses to charge.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes based on reviews.  I have a giant rabbit that sheds pretty good in one room in the house.  We've tried various ""easy"" ways to deal with this, but failed.  So we bought the roomba...almost exclusively because of the reviews.  However...three things.- because it is so loud, we really have to schedule a time for it to run (given everyone is home during the pandemic).  While not large, we have a 4 bedroom house and, when the roomba is running, it can be heard in every corner of the house.- whenever i go to use it, I find it is not charged.  I have to move the unit until it comes alive again (lights turn on) as the electrical connections are made between the unit and its base.  This means, I schedule its use (due to noise) and then cannot run it when desired because i have to wait for it to charge (and, no, I don't have the mental capacity to think ahead to charge it)- and finally, I would say it gets about 80 - 90% of the hair that is on the rug.  It is a tightly woven rug so i would expect it is much closer to a hard surface that something shaggy.  That 10-20% of the hair that is left is spread pretty evenly across the carpet, showing the path the roomba took.  Great, right?It probably should get 1 star, but it does make the carpet marginally better.","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9968783855438232
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about this little machine, but after letting it run around my house with tile floors, rugs, and carpet in 3 bedrooms, I admit I was impressed.This is not a quiet machine though if you're trying to watch TV while the tiny robot gathers the long hair of 2 women, a dog, and a cat.  I work at home, so I'll have to let it run and keep it out of my office.I also had to cut the hair off the brush and remove things I didn't pick up like hair ties, stray dryer sheets that wrapped around the brush roller.  But once I got over the initial disgust at everything my old vacuum and dry swiffer and were swiffer, etc.  missed, then cleaned the machine out which was easy, it is all good now.The horror of what this thing picked up that I have been missing will haunt my dreams.I also bought a cordless Dyson with attachments that will suck a large rug off the floor with the strength of that motor for when I need to quickly vacuum specific rooms or areas, or my SUVs.The Roomba will not always go up from tile floors onto a good, plush living room area rug though, but that was not why I bought it anyway.For tile floors and regular rugs and carpet, I love this and highly recommend it.  Let's see how long it takes for me to wear it out.Warning:  you think you're already getting all the long, human hair and pet hair and dust before you set this loose on hard floors with dry and wet swiffers, vacuums, brooms, etc.  You're wrong.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"ETA 10/9/2020:  This unit does great on hard surfaces like the front hall and the kitchen.  It does great around the perimeter of the room and under furniture.  It goes over those areas about a billion times.  It's actually under the dining room table for the fifth time this morning right now.  We don't eat at the table, so there's only hair/dust for it to vacuum.  I'm sure it got all of that the first or second pass,What it doesn't do a good job of is the center of the room (i.e. the high-traffic areas).  Seriously, I think I could do better with dustbuster!  I think it would do much better if it went back and forth in a logical pattern instead of rambling around aimlessly.ETA:  I'm annoyed that when I use the app or the button on top of the robot to tell it to go back to its dock, it keeps on cleaning and cleaning and cleaning.  This morning, my cats activated it around 6am, and I heard it running when my alarm went off at 6:30.  I used the app to tell it to go back to the dock.  When I came downstairs a little before 7, it was still running.  I pushed the dock button on top of the robot, and it kept cleaning till the battery ran out, at which time I had to move the sofa to get to it so I could carry it back to the dock.The Roomba has run 5 times so far.  I ran it twice the first day since it spent most of its time on the perimeters of the rooms and not enough time in the center where the hair shedding feline monster spends most of his time.  I wasn't terribly impressed the first day.  I did learn how to get it to concentrate on a specific area, though.The second day was better.  It was able to figure out how to get into the front hall and the kitchen and did a decent job overall.  The cats managed to turn it on at 10 o'clock last night, but when they came charging upstairs I heard the whirring and used the app to send it back to the dock.  It's now running for the 5th time.I empty the bin after each run, and it's been full each time.  I'm absolutely amazed by how much dust, human hair, and cat hair it has picked up, and a little embarrassed that I didn't realize the carpet was so dirty!  Roomba even sucked up two catnip toys that it found hidden under the sofa the first day, but I was able to retrieve them.If it keeps cleaning this well, I'll be happy with the money I spent.","Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9826793670654297

   I own three tabby cats and one husky dog, all of whom shed an insane amount of fur. I'm also highly allergic to all of them in addition to suffering from seasonal and dust allergies. (Benefits of pet ownership > my sinuses, apparently.)My house is also quite large. I mainly use it on the main floor, which has a very large and open family room, dining room, kitchen, front entryway, bathroom, and back door area. I also move the Roomba to my upstairs floor to clean the bedrooms. All rooms have hardwood floors with a few area or entry rugs. Prior to owning the Roomba, if I wanted fur-free floors I had to vacuum at least twice a week while wearing a filter mask to avoid sinus infections. I was so exhausted of the upkeep.I was worried that the Roomba wouldn't be able to keep up with the amount of fur in my house and/or would struggle with the transition between rugs and hardwood, but I decided to risk the expense. I'm so glad I did and wish I had bought one years ago!!!!The Roomba is an excellent option for keeping up with daily pet fur and small messes on hardwood floors and carpet. I set it to clean once a day on my main floor, and two or three times a week I carry it upstairs to clean. Every evening I use my large, upright vacuum to vacuum out the Roomba's canister and filter, which takes about a minute's worth of time. Check out my photo to see how much it picks up on my main floor every day! At least once a week I inspect the bottom of the Roomba to check the brushes. Sometimes I remove the brushes and pull or cut out out any stuck threads or fur.It takes about an hour and a half each day to complete its job on my main floor and usually returns to the home base to charge again without issue. If the house is particularly messy I let it charge and run it a second time, but I don't usually need to do this. Sometimes it misses small sections of floor, but since I run it every day it usually hits everywhere at least every other day.One small complaint I have is that when the Roomba moves off a carpeted area or rug and onto the hardwood floor, sometimes it leaves small chunks of fur that must have been caught underneath it. (See my second photo and video.) Considering how amazing a job it does on a daily basis on keeping the hardwood floors fur-free and what my upkeep used to be I'm not going to complain too much about this inconvenience, but I hope that the engineers at Roomba find a way to improve their product over time. Maybe the suction power needs to be increased?The Roomba has greatly reduced my need to do frequent vacuuming and now I can get away with a deep clean vacuum job once every other week. It has been a mental health and sinus saver and I'm so glad I bought it!","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.6033204197883606

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I do recommend it and would buy again.Pros:1. Can run often because it doesn't take too long to charge (2-3 times per day).2. After a few weeks of mapping the house, it easily finds its home without help.3. CLEAN FLOORS - It does a great job picking up hair and dirt, and really does cover the whole house fairly well with regular use. We have not had to use a manual vacuum since getting it, other than for spot jobs like fan blades and corners.4. Price is very good considering it does most everything the newer ones can do, but much less expensive.Neutral observations:1. The bin has to be emptied each run, but it's very easy and quick. (I have many animals and a toddler in my home, so it may be less often for others.)2. Would be true for any vacuum, but you have to pick up items it will suck up, because it will eat it and get stuck, including curtains, bed skirts, and animal toys, etc.Cons:1. It gets stuck under some appliances and scratches itself up thanks to the little antenna bump on the front.2. If you have the standard roller, it will need to be cleaned of hair pretty often.

Vacuuming two or three times a day just isn't something I enjoy, but I live alone and somebody's got to do it. With my little Roomba, I no longer have to. I just tell Alexa on my Echo Plus to start Roomba and off he goes and gets my entire 1,500 sq ft house done on a single charge before needing a nap. I've set the app for him to run once a day, but often ask him to wake up and run again if I've messed up the floors. He NEVER complains. With a couple of ears taped to his top and a little tail on his back, it's like having a new pet in the house. Careful, though. I caught myself talking to it once already asking it if it needed help when it was doing circles under my couch!  He was fine and quickly figured a way out.

The Roomba can almost never find the base on its own, even if placed directly in front of it and told to go home. 2. More importantly, it never seems to charge! Even when we place it on ourselves, or are able to get it to get there on its ""own,"" it somehow loses connection. And then the next time we go to use it, oops there's no charge. We've moved the base to different locations, on tile, on carpet, and we've secured it as best we can so it won't move (it's light as heck, and the barest touch can move it a mile).

It looked like someone opened the box then closed it and returned it. It had all original parts and booklets and was still in the new wrapping. The booklet says to charge for 3 hours but I recommend charging longer before you use it for your first sweeping 🧹 job. It was really easy to hook up to WiFi and the Roomba/iRobot app gave you step by step easy instructions that I believe anyone could follow and set up this lil guy. The app allows you to control the Roomba and start/stop jobs; return to the dock; and make it play sounds when you want to find it in your home.  It dose excellent in the space I have it set up for and cleans 3/4 rooms no problems. I honestly was shocked after emptying the dirt/dust bin on this and seeing how much was in it considering I gust swept 🧹 my floors with my Shark and Dyson about 2 days prior to running the Roomba for the first time. It dose good on carpet but obviously it will not deep clean the carpet as a standard vacuum. It handle the thick rugs no problem and leaves the hardwood and linoleum/tile floors spotless! I run it every day and am truly amazed on how much it picks up! It would do great at picking up pet hair as well. I am very satisfied with my purchase and may be ordering a second one for the other portion of the house 🏡. This thing saves so much time it is incredibly!

   We call her ""Tilley"".  I received Tilley on 12/24/19, so she's been part of our family for about 3 weeks.  I am very pleased with her!  What I feel is important to know about us is that we are a retired couple, and both of us have lower back issues.  Vacuuming is a definite no-no for both of us.  The only rooms where we have area rugs is bedroom.  Our living room, dining room and hallway (see video) are hardwood floors, and kitchen is vinyl tile, and we have no wall-to-wall carpeting.I approached my purchase of Tilley feeling that, if she picked up 80% and I needed to sweep up the rest, I'd be very pleased.  I'm happy to say that this is truly the case.Tilley runs approximately 1.5 hours on one charge.Tilley DOES transition easily from solid floors to carpets.You can see in my video that she seems to ""wander"" around, ""willy-nilly"", not going in any pattern, and I was concerned about this at first.  But eventually she comes back around.Negatives:  As I mentioned, she DOES miss a few areas.  After all, the unit's shape is ROUND, so getting into corners may not be to the degree you would like.  So, if you're picky, you get out a broom and brush out what she missed.  To me, not a big negative.  Another point is that the cup that holds the dirt is small.  This should be obvious - the unit is not as large as a regular size vacuum!  Because we are home when she's going about her job, I usually let her run around for about 45 mins, then I empty her cup, replace it, and send her on her way again!  I find this is most necessary when she does the bedroom carpets.  In my bathrooms, I pick up the throw rugs before I let her loose.  Probably not necessary, but I just choose to take them outside and shake them.  Makes it easier for Tilley to get around in my small bathrooms.Connecting to WIFI was not possible - my iPad and iPhone are both older and will not update to IOS 11.  I'm home most of the time anyway, so I really didn't need that feature.This was probably the best Christmas present I ever bought for myself.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is our 2nd robot vac. Bought it Nov 2018 during Amazon Days. Glad I didn't pay full price. We used it on the main floor of our home but blocked off 2 rooms, leaving approximately 1,000 sq feet for it to vacuum. All but one room is hardwood with the one being carpet. Within 6 months we had to start propping it up to connect to the base to fully charge. At first used a small piece of cardboard. Around 6 months ago we upgraded to a small halloween mask we had laying around. Fast forward to last week when had to use a pair of fluffy socks stuffed under the bottom to angle it in such a way to make contact. Starting last week (Aug 2020, now owned for 21 months) it stopped making contact between unit and base no matter what we did, including sitting on floor holding the unit ON the base. It has officially died. When it ran, it did good. We have 2 short haired dogs and it always got their hair. We emptied the bin daily and kept the unit clean (which you must do often). Overall I would not recommend at its full price. But, if you're someone with a small home or apartment who can get this at a good price, it could be a good fit for you.","Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9989966750144958
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate cleaning and have wanted one of these for a LONG time.  I am happy to have it and use it weekly, BUT it was not the cleaning savior I had hoped for.  We have 3 cats and dark wood floors, so I bought it mostly to handle the hair, which it does wonderfully.  Suction is great, no complaints there.  My main problem with this machine is that it gets stuck in the same room/area for much longer than needed, and sometimes never goes to other parts of the house that need it.  It does not do a good job getting under the toe kick of the kitchen cabinets.  If I had it to do over again, I would have paid for one of the more upgraded models.  Also, it is VERY LOUD.  I work from home and if this thing is running in the next room, I have to pause it to take a phone call.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had this little thing for a few weeks and I am absolutely loving it.  Our house is about 1000 sq ft so it’s pretty small and the vacuum covers the entire house in one run.  I can run this thing a handful of times in one day!  It’s a bit loud so I don’t, but it’s not as loud as our normal vacuum.  The living area is tile and the bedrooms are carpet, and it goes in the rooms no problem.  It goes right over my low pile runners no problem but doesn’t go up onto my shag area rug.  It has no problem going into my kitchen mat/runner which surprised me. We have a dog who sheds a lot and the tile was so difficult to clean because the broom pretty much sends half of it floating into the air.  This thing is so low profile it doesn’t stir up the fur and it has good enough suction that it picks up a ton.I also have a husband and four kids who go in and out of the house pretty much constantly and sweeping multiple times a day was annoying.  Since I got this thing, not only does it get up all of the dirt, but my kids are more conscious about wiping their feet.  We named him Bertram after the butler in their favorite kids comedy show and giving him that personality has been fun for us.And every single day all of the beds in the house get vacuumed under while I take care of other things!","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9965404272079468

They sent an entire replacement unit (expect for the battery and dock). Same problem. So they sent me a second replacement unit. Same problem, except this time it stopped after 5 minutes. iRobot asked me to send it back to them to repair it. It took over 2 weeks for them to get the proper shipping supplies to me. This is now 2 months later and a total of over 2 hours on the phone with them, never mind the time packing and unpacking the various replacements. I had an Eufy for 4 years that worked like a charm.

Seriously, my floors have never been cleaner! I can walk around barefoot without feeling like I have gunk on my feet. I have a long haired cat so there seems to always be cat hair as well as my human hair everywhere. I was a little apprehensive about getting him set up as I can sometimes be technically challenged. But this was a breeze. If you can read you can get this thing set up in a few minutes. I got him all charged up and started with cleaned, mopped floors. We have ceramic tile and wood floors with one large area rug and the transition between the difference surfaces is great.  He does run around in a very haphazard way, so if this is gonna bug you, I’d recommend you set him to do his job when you aren’t around. He does get the job done! I have him scheduled to run every morning and he keeps the floors nice and clean! I love the fact that he fits under most of our furniture including the beds! Vacuuming under beds is not my idea of fun. I wouldn’t consider this a method for deep cleaning but it sure is a wonderful addition to our family!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little guy is a must! I have a 65 lb lab/pit dog and she NEVER stops shedding. I was using my regular vacuum at least once a day, as I can not stand dirty floors. This Roomba does an amazing job! I have a very expensive Miele vacuum, which I love, so I wasn’t too excited to spend a lot on the Roomba. I can’t see why, after having it for a few weeks, anyone would buy the more expensive ones. This 675 cleans my hardwoods and area rugs perfectly.Setting up the WiFi was a bit of a pain and though the app shows connected, I’ve never been able to get my phone to run the Roomba, but that doesn’t bother me. I just manually push the button.I have this little guy clean nearly every night. Before I go to bed, I do a walkthrough my house, picking up items that might compromise little Roomba’s efforts. Lucky for me, my furniture is high enough off the ground so it’s able to easily clean under my sofa and arm chairs.As someone else mentioned, DO NOT watch this thing in action. It will make you crazy watching the completely random pattern. That’s why I run it at night. As a test, I did put a piece of string in a specific spot in my kitchen, the next morning, it was gone. Yay Roomba! The amount of ick in its little dirt compartment every morning is a testament to a job well done. (One time my husband asked if I’d just mopped... nope, but little Roomba had cleaned in the night) I make sure to clean the bin every time (and remove the filter and bang it against the garbage can) it has cleaned, and about once a week I remove the brush and clean it as well.I’ve now only used my Miele vacuum once since having this and that was after I took down my Christmas tree - there were needles all over the floor. ( I don’t sweep with a broom, as I feel like the dirt would buildup in between my hardwood) I suppose that’s the ONLY drawback to a Roomba... when you want immediate and specific results. I could have pushed the spot clean and it would have probably cleaned it, now that I think about it.To all of you clean freaks out there: this Roomba is better, WAY better, than sliced bread.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wavered on buying a robot vacuum for a long time, but finally caved and bought Minion. Even with the cons listed below, I would 100% recommend this Roomba to family and friends (which I already have)! Minion has saved me so much time, and I'm enjoying actually walking barefoot on my floors again.PROS:Easy to set up and use. I especially love the ""scheduled clean"" feature on the app! I've scheduled Minion to run while I am at work, so all I do the day of cleaning is move a few items like cat toys off the floor and then simply empty the dust bin when I get home.Cleans pretty thoroughly. Previously no mater how much I swept, my floor seemed to always be covered in cat litter, dirt, clumps of black kitty hair...Minion is great at getting about 98% of it, switching between my carpets and hardwood/tile with ease. (My apartment is mostly hardwood with a few large area rugs and tile in the kitchen.)Charge lasts a while. Minion is able to clean my entire 700-sq foot apartment (except for the bathroom) on one charge, about 1.5 hours.Doesn't scratch my hardwood floors.CONS:The Roomba is louder than I expected, especially on hardwood or tile. Because I live in an apartment building with thin walls, I only run Minion during the day.It's also a bit thicker/taller than I expected, but is still able to fit under most of my furniture (6 inches seems to be the lowest it can fit under).I get that the robot has to bump into things to get a sense of where it's at, but it bumps objects fairly roughly. You can expect your kitchen chairs, trashcans, etc. to move around. There's actually marks on the front of my Roomba from where it's bumped into the wall, etc.I had to buy a separate virtual wall to stop Minion from running into my cat's dishes. You WILL need one of these devices if you have a pet. It was very necessary and does its job, but it was a little annoying to have to buy a separate expensive accessory.It can take a few tries for the vacuum to dock itself. It'll run into the docking station and move it around. Also, I found out that if you physically pick up the Roomba during a cleaning cycle (say, to move it to another spot), it won't be able to dock itself. Just fyi. Now, I just leave Minion to do its thing and dock itself whenever it finishes.All that being said, I love how much time Minion has saved me, and coming home to clean floors every day with so little effort.

The 900 series leaves precise back and forth patterns of parallel lines on carpet. This one looks like a kindergartener scribbled the cleaning route when it’s done LOL!

That being said, I bought this roomba thinking it would be able to autonomously vacuum my place. It can't. I have it running every day, and it's only successfully completed one job (meaning it started and docked itself without help). I cannot understand how the design team would allow an autonomous VACUUM to get stuck on virtually any carpet that includes black somewhere in the design. Instead of relying on optical sensors for cliff detection, they should use sonar or something else. At a MINIMUM, they should allow you to turn the cliff sensors off with the app. Instead, you can find videos of people literally opening the case of the roomba and modifying the circuit board so that it will do what it's supposed to out of the box.3 stars until they add a software disable to the cliff sensors. Selling additional hardware (lighthouses and islands or whatever they are called) to bandaid your bad design is even worse.

We move shoes to a certain place, put baby  toys away, get papers and other obstacles put away and close doors to rooms we don't want to clean or know that roomba will get stuck in. The two common issues are roomba sucking up a string or toy that we missed, and roomba accidentally closing a door and getting trapped. Otherwise, it's pretty interesting to watch roomba bump around at random and actually hit all of the spots over the course of the cleaning. He cleans the best when the floors are already pretty clean and he is just collecting the loose dirt that the dogs have dragged in.Noise wise, it is a little louder than we expected. We have hard floors with little cracks. Roomba kind of stumbles around and makes noise, making it hard to watch tv without cranking up the volume. I run it when I am doing something I don't need to listen to. It's great white noise and doesn't disturb the sleeping baby.On carpet it isn't very loud. Cleans great.Easy to clean out.

He's constantly getting stuck under stuff and has to beat his way out of it. He also doesn't go in a nice, neat pattern. Oh no, he goes all over the damn place for one corner to the other.

(I didn't try any more expensive vacuums.) The strong points of this vacuum is it's cleaning power. It seemed to do the best job cleaning and was able to get under things the other vacuums didn't, like a sofa with a dust skirt. All other vacuums encountered it and stopped and turned around, this touched it to see if it could pass and kept going slowly until it did. The other vacuums also somehow managed to get caught under this sofa when they made it under but then could not come out passed the dust skirt. This vacuum is by far the loudest of the bunch, which can get a little annoying. I'd recommend this to someone who would have it work when not home, but if you're gonna use it when home, i'd recommend ilife or uefy. another issue is it has a hard time docking. Even when it finds the dock which is a crapshoot in itself, it somehow manages to screw it up and not dock. Then it moves from side to side which only moves the dock into an awkward position which then makes docking without human assistance almost impossible. If they could figure out the noise, docking, and added another ""spinny whisker"" on the other side it would be great! Another thing would be to learn the house.

Those are for another day...maybe.Oh well, I'm happy thought, I just can't schedule if to run overnight, I have to stand around and baby-sit it so it doesn't stall out on a ledge or on those string things at the end of the carpet.Besides, the cats are getting use to it, now.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first robot vacuum, so I wasn't sure what to expect on performance and reliability. Waited a month before writing review. It has vacuumed approximately 18 times so far. Its total job is about 750 square feet of the first floor of our house. The random pattern of its trajectory is sometimes frustrating to watch, however when each job is done, I have to admit the floors look good. It looks as though someone has vacuumed the house. Occasionally it doesn't get to certain areas in the kitchen for some reason. One time it failed to enter the kitchen at all. At first, the vacuum never successfully docked when it was done. It would just run out of battery wherever it happened to be vacuuming at the time. I moved the dock to a more centrally located portion of our home, and this has increased docking success, but it is still only docking successfully about 50% of the time. This is not a huge problem, as it takes 5 seconds to pick it up and dock it manually, but I still wish it had a higher success rate.  It is fairly good about not getting stuck. I fixed the problem areas around the house where it was initially getting stuck [by moving rugs, adjusting a chair, etc], and now it has completed 4 jobs in a row without getting stuck. I like the wifi connectivity, and Alexa compatibility. For the price, it is probably a perfectly good vacuum. I suggest keeping your floor free of small debris, such as socks. It has sucked up a sock twice so far, which ended up wrapped around the main brush. The first time it happened, the iRobot app did not notify me, and the vacuum just kept working. The second time it happened, the vacuum shut itself down and I got a notification on the app saying ""please check brushes"". As long as you go into it understanding that this is not the Jetsons and that you will probably fairly often have to manually dock it, and occasionally free it from getting stuck, and that it may miss some spots during some jobs, you will likely be happy. :)","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9963250160217285

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for $199 on Black Friday because I couldn't resist the price. I've wanted a Roomba for a long time but I'm glad I waited for the technology to improve.Right out of the box, I flipped it over to check out the underbelly. I found that the piece that houses the brushes was askew and not snapped properly in place. It took a couple minutes and a flat head screwdriver to pry it out and then snap it fully back in place. I'm only glad I didn't break it.I'm using it in a carpeted, sunken (one step lower) family room which is also the room I enter from the garage and the room I use the most. It works well in this room. It fits underneath most of the furniture, easily transitions onto the door mat, is less noisy than a traditional vacuum and makes adorable robot noises.It has some quirks: It doesn't clean in a logical pattern and seems to return to the same areas repeatedly. It particularly seems to ""like"" cleaning under furniture, but that may be because the pieces are against the wall and it pays particular attention to walls and corners. I appreciate that it cleans so well under the sofa and chairs, which wouldn't otherwise happen nearly as often, but the middle of the room doesn't seem to get the same attention. The good news is that with the app, you can schedule daily cleanings if you want to, so all the areas are bound to get clean. I set daily cleanings for the first few days, now just twice a week. Setting a schedule has helped me keep the room picked up and looking nice.I positioned the charging base out of sight under a small chest, and this is working out fine. It took a couple tries for it to dock itself the first time, and now it has no trouble.Be aware that you'll need to ""vacuum proof"" the house. Cords are an obvious thing (mine got tangled up one day while I was at work), but it will find anything that's loose, even pieces of baseboard trim.I tried out this 675 model on the rest of my house (1500 sq feet of hard floors) and I was favorably impressed. It effortlessly navigated the transitions between rooms which have slightly different floor heights. It had no problem with door mats, but couldn't manage bedroom or bathroom rugs. It gets up a bit of speed in open areas and I noticed that sometimes it slows down when it approaches objects but other times it rams into them full speed. It also became ""stranded on a cliff"" when it approached a step down at full speed. It stopped before falling down but seemed to have gone too far over the edge to back up. As with my carpeted room, it focused more on the periphery than the middle areas of rooms, and it went back and forth between the kitchen and living room several times before venturing down the hallway into the bedrooms and bathroom (these rooms barely got a cleaning).From this experiment, I saw the usefulness of a Roomba and decided to buy a second one for the majority of the house (the newer i7 which has the room mapping feature) and it is working out very well.As a new owner, I'm so far very happy with the purchase. I gave it 4 stars all around because there's always room for improvement.","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2018",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9989074468612671
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second robot vacuum I’ve had. The other one was a different brand and only lasted a year, so I thought I’d give this one a try since Roombas have a history of being more durable. It cleans well- good suction, cleans the baseboards. The dust bin is easy to remove and clean. It seems to have a good battery life, and it moves faster than my previous robo vac. It’s one of the basic models, so I don’t expect it to be perfect. What I don’t like about it: it’s pretty loud, it doesn’t have a remote and you can’t control the direction it goes from the app, it seems a bit more brainless than my other bot vac (constantly bumping into things), and I’ve had major problems trying to get it to connect to wifi and the app after upgrading routers. It’s a decent vacuum and it gets the job done, but I’m not overly impressed by it.

Because of this, I know that the Roomba is very easy to take apart, and most parts can be soaked in soapy bleach water. FYI to other customers who might have this problem in the future, Q-tips work really well for this type of clean up. I have had my Roomba for about a week now, and if this little robot actually lasts for a few years, I will be a Roomba owner for life. I debated buying one for 3 years, and let me tell you, it was well worth the price.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I definitely didn’t have incredibly high hopes with this base model Roomba. However it has exceeded my expectations in certain areas. For one, I have two cats and it picks up more hair than I ever thought existed. It works well both on my LVT and tile on the ground floor and carpet and tile on the second floor. It finds itself constantly hung up on my newer floor mat in front of the entry way, because the mat hasn’t settled yet. Occasionally it will get stuck on my swivel barstools (curved base). These are minor inconveniences. I’ve noticed it has absolutely no rhyme or reason to where it goes... Sometimes it goes immediately into the living room avoiding the kitchen, sometimes it’s the other way around. My main reason for buying this was to pickup the litter that was scattered around my main floor from the cats. It definitely does that. If I had any foresight, I would have went a model or two higher just to be able to have the newer rolling brushes since my hair has gotten stuck in these bristles. But whatever, if you want an intro Roomba with the name and the connectivity and don’t care if it knows where it is (no mapping on this model) then go for it. But man don’t buy it full price, wait for it to go on sale (I scored it at $199).","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2021",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.7111515402793884
3.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought this for me two years ago. It is going strong, but I also clean it with a cleaning kit from another brand at least once a month. I've only had one issue. About one year into using this, my machine quit making proper contact to charge on the port. If this happens to you, just remove the front wheel and put one to two washers between the front while and machine. For some reason, after a certain amount of use the wheel tends to move deeper inside the machine which affects it's ability to charge.Edit: My first of these vacuums lasted for about 3 years and over 1500 jobs according to the app. This machine does require a great deal of maintenance, but once you watch a couple YouTube videos, you know the ins and outs. I just received my second vacuum. My biggest complaint is that I could never get my first or second one to complete the initial setup and connect to WiFi through my Android devices. I tried for hours on both. However, when I used my old iPad that is logged into the same account and app as my androids, setup worked easily. Irobot really needs to fix the issue with Android devices. Once connected, the app works fine on android, but it seems you need to have an apple product to get it to setup.Anyways, I still find this model in the 600 series to be the most cost effective robot vacuums.","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9874833226203918

I was vacuuming every single day and I still didn't feel like our floors were that clean. The first day we used the roomba I noticed our floors looked so much better. I kept the brush clean and replaced filters often. It worked extremely well, until the charging port died last month. I was really upset that I had just bought this roomba and it was already having issues.. But to be fair it probably does 10 times the work because of the husky hair. I reached out to Amazon and they replaced the entire roomba with NO cost to me. I recently had a negative experience with a Shark vacuum from Kohls that we purchased in March. Shark charged us shipping cost (20 dollars) and it took weeks to get the new vacuum. This shark vacuum was not used as much as our roomba or pulled up as much hair as the roomba.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have had our iRobot Roomba for a week and it's already made a huge difference in helping keep the house clean and picking up sand and dirt that comes in from our shoes.  I was really considering a more expensive version that had advanced mapping and other advanced features, but this one got so many great reviews I figured I'd give it a shot and am happy we did.I noticed a lot of reviewers name their robot, so my wife named ours HAL.  HAL is parked in the mudroom and has a 7am wakeup call everyday to clean our entire 1st floor.  Our 1st floor is open concept (kitchen, living room, dining room) and all hardwood or tile with a few area rugs.  It's about 1200 sq ft.  There's also a kitchen island HAL needs to negotiate and 2 separate rooms.  Sometimes HAL goes into those rooms and spends too much time there.  But for the majority of the time, HAL gets himself out of jams and manages to clean the entire 1st floor.I knew we would be emptying HAL's debris compartment, so I wont give a low score based on that, but I can definitely see the value in purchasing a more expensive robot that self-empties it's compartment.  The compartment doesn't hold a lot so we empty ours after every run.  But not having a more expensive one to compare to, I don't know how much better that really is.HAL tells you when he's stuck.  Today he got stuck under the couch by driving up and over a power strip.  I freed him and he went on to clean more stuff.

I was having trouble keeping up with their shedding and I just don't have the time to vacuum every day.  Even at 2 times a week there were little hair ball tumble weeds rolling around....So I got the roomba so I could keep up with their hair, fully expecting to still need to use my other vacuum for a thorough clean.  Our worst spot was the hallway: the hair vortex.  But since using the roomba about every other day, no hairy tumble weeds!  We have wood, tile, and vinyl floors with just two area rugs in the house.The only downside is how it cleans the rugs.  (But it still cleans better than I thought it would.)  With some of the hair, it just brushes it off the edge of the rug or drags it.  So you kind of get swirls of hair on the rug.  I'm sure if I had bought a more expensive/advanced model then it would clean better.  But if I could afford to spend $400 on a roomba...i would just get a maid service lol.  I find this to still be acceptable performance because when I empty the roomba...omygawd you know it's doing it's job.  I was surprised by how much dirt and dog hair it picked up.

The amount of loose hair, dirt and dander generated requires that I vacuum at least 2 rooms a day to avoid having to watch the 1 year old Rott find and eat dust bunnies made of his own detached fur and dander. Watching that will make you want to vomit up dinner, seriously. Factor in my aging and mobility issues, and the Roomba becomes less of a convenience, and more of a necessity that I didn't know I had.It requires a lot of maintenance, however:1. The battery connections have to be cleaned every other day to make sure charging takes place.2. The debris bin is exceptionally small, so it has to be dumped and the filter cleaned daily, and during the first week, you will probably want to empty it two or three times in a day.3. In large living areas, the vacuum's path becomes unpredictable, but once you get used to watching it maneuver around table legs and crumpled up rugs, you can adjust it's route by lightly nudging it with your toes. It doesn't do so well without guidance in the den and living areas, but if you just leave it to run and sit and watch a film, it can do most of the job on it's own without support.4. It's noisy, and it takes longer than it should, because it bounces about aimlessly.5. The recommended maintenance schedule is ridiculous. Even the wheels have to be replaced periodically! Had I known I would have to buy so much plastic waste just for upkeep of the device, I may have skipped it altogether.All the negatives aside, it does help in a big way.

The noise from the machine is very loud, and even worse is the constant banging into all the furniture, scratching floors and damaging trim.It can't dock properly by itself unless the base is screwed into something, it will just push the base around. If it doesn't dock properly and runs down the battery, it will squawk at high volume demanding to be charged, regardless of time of day. So many nights I woke up to a very loud ""PLEASE CHARGE ROOMBA"" because the battery had died while the robot looked to be on the charging base. Even placing it on the dock by hand it is nearly impossible to line up the charging contacts and the lights on the device don't give a good indication that it's charging or not.Worst of all, I got a new phone and this robot wouldn't connect to it. I wanted to change the schedule I'd set with the previous phone but can't, so I'm cursed to use the bad schedule forever. ""Factory Reset"" didn't seem to do anything.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am generally happy with this vacuum cleaner, but to make it effective in my home I have had to develop a way to run it in ""semi-manual"" mode. My house does not have an open floor plan. The kitchen, living room, dining room, and bedrooms are all separated by doors and hallways. And it is well furnished, meaning there is not a lot of open floor space. Because of this, there are many places the Roomba can get stuck and need to be manually relocated. Also, it is very unlikely to find home base at the end of its cycle. To make things work I have had to eliminate automatically scheduling. I only run it when it is convenient for me to give it the attention it needs. I block off one section of my home at a time to let it do it's work. Then I manually shut it off and carry it back to home base. For example, this morning I put it in the master bedroom and set it loose for 45 minutes.  It did a good job of cleaning the bedroom, master bath, and walk-in closet. Then I carried back and placed it a couple feet in front of the docking station and let it dock itself. Tomorrow I may do the kitchen in the same way. But just scheduling a time and letting it run through the house and expecting it to find home at the end will not work for me.The other thing to know is the dirt receptacle is very small. The first few times I had to stop it to empty the receptacle evry 15-20 minutes. But now it can go 45-60 minutes since the floors are generally clean. Must of the initial cleaning came from heavy dust under furniture that rarely got cleaned before.Bottom line, my floors are cleaner with the Roomba than they were when I used an upright vacuum because I use it more often and it gets under most furniture. But it does require attention.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.8961743712425232
3.0 out of 5 stars,"We have wanted the Roomba for a while and debated for a long time as to which one to buy after reading reviews.  We have had this model for a year so I am a little late writing a review.  What the Roomba does well: it has great suction power.  What it doesn’t do well: it doesn’t go corner to corner so it misses a lot of the floor unless you let it run for hours on end.  It cleans the same spot over and over again. It gets stuck under a standard couch or recliner so if you are away it will just shut down.  No matter where the base is placed, it rarely makes it back onto it.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9886110424995422
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always said I would never ask for an appliance as a Christmas gift. Now that my life includes a crumb-laden toddler, I’m learning, in a very hands on manner, why the “never say never” phrase exists. When my husband brought up the idea I enthusiastically and immediately auto ordered our new Roomba.Initially, upon opening Rosie, I immediately noticed her quality and seeming durability. In the past week she has endured toy vegetable wars with the toddler, who feels that Rosie is the new space-invading pet and is adamant to stand her ground and make her dominance known. She has only been stuck twice, once on my sliding glass door, and once her wheel became stuck in my romantic, low-hanging sheer curtains that I forgot to pull up before starting the session. I was pleasantly surprised that my delicate curtains were not damaged and that when Rosie realized her wheel was entangled, she *immediately* stopped and called for help.My floors are imaculately clean at all times. I can plan cleaning sessions for late morning and at night after everyone is in bed and wake up to clean floors again instead a growing to-do list. And if my messy husband and child create a disaster in the afternoon, I no longer have the  “I just did this” meltdown, and merely press the “clean” button on my phone with zero stress. No more crumbs and dirt sticking to my feet and no more sweeping the floors five times a day. No more feeling that I can’t catch up on basic cleaning because of the tiny tornado that follows me around. I’m currently looking for new hobbies to occupy all of my spare time. I HIGHLY recommend this product to any housewife on a budget. It is purely LIFE CHANGING!

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: A little over a year after purchasing my Roomba 675, she developed dementia.  Our poor Rhonda was once a hard working member of the household.  Now she can’t find her home and can barely walk.  She never makes it over rugs, has to be pushed along carpeted surfaces, and scratches our hardwood floors all along the way.  I bought a Goovi for half the price and hate to say I’m going to put Rhonda out by the road.Original review: My Roomba 675 was delivered today and she’s already run for over 3.5 hours.  I’ve emptied her six times.  You know, I clean my house.  It is amazing how much she picks up and how the air seems so much more fresh and clean.  I was debating whether to give four or five stars.  It was hard choosing what brand and model of robot vacuum cleaner to purchase.  My mom and sister have Eufys and love them, as well.  I have another friend who has the Eco whatever brand by Amazon and loves hers.  The only reason I knocked it down a star was because the vacuum has had some trouble docking.  I think that is because of our slightly open floor plan.  Once it seemed to be confused in our powder room.  The docking station is right behind that bathroom wall.  Just now I had to kind of block the vacuum to help it guide itself back to its docking station.  Otherwise, when I tell it to dock it just keeps rambling around.  It isn’t the quietest thing, but it makes way less noise than a traditional vacuum cleaner.  You can actually hear the television if you turn it up a bit.  I learned through research that the quieter robot vacuums don’t have as much suction.  Definitely want suction over quietness.  My mom and sister told me that they ran their vacuums a bunch the first day and then just once a day after that.  I am loving this thing.  I will have to get one for my upstairs now.  Great way to get the kids to clean their small toys.  “Don’t want Rosie to eat your lol dolls, do you?  That my little pony hair could get sucked right up.  Oops, I think it just ate a lego.”  Watch the kids run over and start to clean after that.  This is one of my best purchases ever.

The first thing I noticed was how loud it is for such a small device. You can't just let this guy run casually in the background; it will still freak out your baby and your pets like a regular vacuum. But beyond that it is not a time saver. I have to babysit this thing and end up spending more time getting it unstuck than if I just busted out the actual vacuum. I'm finally writing this review because it's inability to do the simple task of avoiding getting stuck has at long last broken my spirit. I want to cry. Every single time it gets stuck under the very middle of my bed and the wall. I can't reach it so I have to grab a broom to try and pull it free. This time even that didn't work. I had to take off my mattress and wrestle the Roomba free because of the useless dime-sized notch that inexplicably protrudes from the top of the device, begging to get stuck.

Downloaded the app and let the device charge three hours. That’s when the problems began. I could not get the app to connect to the device despite multiple attempts. I finally just hit the clean button. The device died twice while cleaning and we had to hit the clean button again each time to reactivate. It did pick dirt up well. Finally it returned itself to base. The next day we tried again with the same results. Today the device left the base, turned a circle, and went back to base. It now will no longer charge.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: Less than a year later it stopped charging. It was used maybe 12 to 15 times in the 10 months I had it. It doesn’t connect with base to charge.. you have to put something underneath the back of the roomba to make sure the contacts at the front point downward at charging points on base. And even then it is really hard to get it to do it. Obviously poorly made I wouldn’t recommend—————-If you have a shedding animal, you will love this. We have a husky/shepherd mix and he sheds like crazy. I almost never have dog hair on my hardwood floors rolling around like tumbleweed anymore...I got this on sale for 199.99... it was worth the price. But if you want a ""smarter"" roomba.. i suggest the 900 series and up... the 900 series has the ability to map out your home so it always knows where it is. That would have been worth the extra 100 or whatever dollars to me. Its sad to watch it bounce around and not know what it is doing really.This doesn't mean it doesn't function properly. It is defaulted to roam around for 90 minutes so it should eventually get every area if you set it up for auto cleaning. But when it is ready to go ""home"" to charge, and it doesn't have the mapping, it struggles to find its base. it eventually will... but if its in another room it could take 20 minutes for it to find its home base.Another useful way to use this is to turn it on and sweep hard to reach areas... pushing the dirt in front of it and it is acting as a robo dustpan, while also vacuuming areas on its own. Because you have to do sweeping still... but way less often. Maybe only once a week (or less depending on your layout and interior design)... This thing makes it very easy to keep the floors clean, and to not walk around getting things stuck to your foot constantly. But if you do get the 600 series models, make sure they are on sale... anything over 199.99 is too much in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2018",70 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9990285634994507
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the idea of having smart devices and have tried to make my home as automated as possible. I have waited (not sure why) on purchasing a smart robot vacuum. I purchased the iRobot Roomba 675 after reading the high reviews and was not certain what to expect. On initial unboxing, the Roomba was super easy to setup. The base charge was 50%. It charged to 100% in a very short amount of time. The app setup was easy to connect to my home wireless. I set it up to respond to Alexa. Asked Alexa to make the Roomba clean and away it went. I was downstairs and heard it moving about the house upstairs. The app informed me it was complete and the battery was at 22%. However, it seemed to freak out about docking and I will need to keep an eye on that issue. I had the docking station under my bed and it did not seem to like that so I have moved it and will see what happens next time.I would have given it 5 stars but the issues with the Roomba having trouble returning to the docking station after cleaning and the battery going from 100% to 22% after 1 hour use is the reason for 4 stars. Still, love this little thing!Results:I was SHOCKED to find out how full the bin was after cleaning! It was completely full of dust bunnies. I have hard wood floors upstairs with an area rug and a runner rug. So most of the bin appears to have been lint, hair (human and dog), dust. After cleaning, it sounds weird, but I could tell and feel when walking bare foot that the floor was cleaner. I used a flashlight to check areas under beds and hard to reach areas and could see the tire marks of the Roomba and noticed very little dust bunnies that tend to collect with hard wood flooring. It really did a spectacular job out of the gate and hope this helps with cleaning the floors that was done with broom and mop in the past.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2019",70 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9963809847831726
3.0 out of 5 stars,"NOTHING about this roomba is quiet. But it does work fairly well, not great, but fairly well.Got it mostly for picking up dog hair, and it does that pretty well. Deep cleaning, not so much. It struggles to to get dirt off the entryway rug.The randomized way it vacuums causes it to miss areas. I watched it in on room of the house for the 90 minute run time and there was a spot approximately one foot by six inches that it missed. I watched it go by it dozens of times, but never hit that spot. It does this pretty regularly.Overall it’s alright. I suspect a cheaper brand may have done the same job as this for half the cost.It gets stuck a lot. More than I think is acceptable. It seems to get stuck between the entryway rug and hard wood floor. One wheel will be on rug, the other on floor and it stops and gives an error alert. You can easily just slide it with your foot off the rug and start it again and it’s fine. Doesn’t seem like this should be an issue.The wifi feature is great - I have to address that. It’s nice to be able to start it when I leave work and it get the majority of dog hair picked up before I get home. That is quite helpful.Probably wouldn’t buy again.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, this Roomba is a great purchase. Given enough time, and the proper environment, it will adequately clean my floors. The gen 1 navigation software is the only thing that lets you down on this model. I have a reasonably open and clear living room, however, the gen 1 navigation will often spend a majority of its time in a single corner of the room. The Roomba will escape the corner briefly, making a single long straight pass into my main living space, then return to the corner it clearly loves. The most current job has been running for 45min, and 30 of those minutes have been spent in that very extremely well-swept corner. Perhaps it is because this corner gets the most sun. The robot just wants to work with the warm light glinting futuristically off its gleaming hull. Dreaming, perhaps longing, for the wide-open fields and rolling California hills just beyond the edge of the carpet. Looking to the skies and wishing to join its kind exploring the planets and stars, sucking up dust on a long and endless martian plateau. After about 90 minutes these dreams must end as its batteries run low.

It often takes 15 minutes to dock even though it's in ""dock"" mode. You have to prep the house or it will try to mate with your cords and will knock down anything connected to a low hanging wire (e.g. a speaker, a corded telephone). It will leave a room and go back in a minute like a senile person who can't remember where he just was.Having said that it was worth getting because it goes under your couch and in your corners.

But after the first 3-4 days it does a fantastic job (mostly). If the first area it covers has lots of debris, it tends to focus its efforts there & the other rooms don't get the love they need. I send it out a 2nd time to get full coverage.After reading many of the reviews, I ensure that I thoroughly clean the Roomba after it finishes each job. The bin gets emptied, and I remove any hair from the wheels and brushes. Then I wipe with a barely damp cloth. I have a dog & a cat and it's astounding how may furballs accumulate in just 24 hours. The iRobot must be run daily. If I skip a day, then I need to send it out twice.One of the things I don't especially like is the noise emanating from the unit. My home is mostly vinyl plank flooring (no rugs) , meaning there is nothing to dampen the sound. Whenever possible, I start the cleaning as I'm leaving the house.I find it helps to get as much off the floor as possible (i.e., barstools, trash bins, pet food bowls, desk chair, kitty litter box are all lifted off the floor, as are electric cords & cables...at least as much as possible). This process takes less than 5 minutes and makes a huge difference in the thoroughness of the iRobot. I also turn on all the lights. I read somewhere that it helps the iRobot to see although I'm not sure if it's applicable to my model. It does seem to help, but maybe I'm imagining it. I don't think my model has a built in camera.This little gizmo saves 30-60 minutes daily, which is wonderful. It is so nice not seeing fur balls everywhere and being able to walk around barefoot.

Roomba hated that carpet, it thought the black carpet was a staircase and would avoid it.I searched and found a Utube video on modifying the sensors to ignore cliff detection....added those white paper strips with tape over the sensors and now the roomba rolls right onto the black carpet and does a great job, IMO.So for anyone who finds this post and is having issues with WIFI, or DDWRT, or finishing setup you might try the settings I got to finally work....and good luck!","Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9993793964385986
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the iRobot 675 three months ago and was amazed at the positive side of what it does like clean under beds and in corners, etc. However, I've found the quality of the machine and the maintenance a complete turnoff. I've followed all guidelines explicitly and now, at 3 months old, I have to wait for a battery replacement that's (you guessed it) out of stock. To her credit, a patient representative from iRobot helped me troubleshoot the battery which was completely dead but I, of course, wonder why the company doesn't just replace the whole unit. It's cost me mega time and money to accommodate the robot since it backs off black border rugs which meant replacing my dark area rugs with lighter ones. It just seems to me a company should bend over backwards to accommodate a customer, not the other way around. Unfortunately for me, I kept it past the return date because I wanted it to work so badly, and now I'm stuck with it. Do not buy the 675 and find out what impediments to operation you need to be aware of. For me, the 675 is an extremely pricy duster.","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9946551322937012
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this item after reading mostly positive reviews. I used it for only two cleanings and returned it since it didn't work for my needs. I have a short-haired dog who sheds enough that two to three cleanings at minimum per week are needed to maintain my home. I should clarify that I wasn't looking for a vacuum to do the entire job of cleaning my home. I just wanted one that could  help me maintain between my  deeper cleanings. This vacuum mostly pushed fur balls around, which were ultimately cleaned only when I swept by hand. I did rate this product more than one star because it picked up some sand and dirt on my hardwood floors without problems. It also picked up dirt and sand from some shaggy and flat area rugs. This model is not an expensive vacuum, so the cleaning pattern was random, and spots were missed. From what I've read, Roomba's higher-end models have a more consistent cleaning pattern and might do a better job. After my experience, I now wonder if the buyer is paying more for the brand than for the actual quality of the item. I will continue looking for other options.","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9960153698921204

2.0 out of 5 stars,"We've had the Roomba 675 for 4 months and I would not recommend a Roomba product to anyone. Let's start with the Roomba app. Either the 675 is the most basic model or the folks at iRobot/Roomba can't offer any useful options in their app unless you spend over $300. for the 675, the only options are to set a schedule or start a cleaning job immediately. That's it. Apps for ther less expensive robovacs will also spot vacuum right where you put the device, vacuum just one room, vacuum the edge of an area, send the device back to its charger, or maneuver the robovac's direction from the app. iRobot/Roomba's app is pretty sad in comparison.The 675 is also a very tall device. It frequently gets stuck under cabinets and appliances if a rug or mat is too close by, so those have to get picked up every night if we don't want the 675 pinned down. On other rugs, if the 675 moves off of them at just the right angle, it tips in a way that shuts it down. The 675 can make it interesting to wake up and see if it found a new way to tell us how we need to set up our home so it can do its job.Save yourself $50-$75 and get something other than a Roomba 675.

Another annoyance is that if it’s not seated within a millimeter of accuracy on its base it doesn’t charge. So you may think it’s charged up but nope, it didn’t. It’s loud. It seems to vacuum the same areas repeatedly and miss others. The schedule could be easier to change in the app. It was easy to set up with wifi but that’s the only good feature that I found.

We have moved it several times and it’s still and issue not every time but often .I am wondering if I have to much flooring ? I think it’s 1300sqft downstairs .. all hard flooring with a few carpets .I think it’s worth the cost and I love the concept of this iRobot vacuum . I’m almost thinking of getting 2 of them so they can work together and hopefully one will make it back to a docking station . I’m even thinking of the mopping one . I recommend this vacuum even with the issues I have , because so far my floors look so much better no more dog hair . Plus I’ve paid well over $200 for a vacuum that I have to do all the work and our time is valuable right ?

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After THREE years of contemplating whether or not to buy a Roomba, my husband and I finally decided to bite the bullet. I did some quick research and settled on this one. We had a baby in August, so clean floors are more important now. I was primarily looking for one that is good for pet hair, and this one advertises that it is ""ideal"" for pet hair. We have a German Shepherd mix, and he sheds A LOT.I have now had this product for about a month, and here are my thoughts:Cleaning Quality - My floors have never been cleaner. I don't see clumps of dog hair all around my house. However, and I would think this is obvious, it does not replace regularly cleaning my floors. I still steam vac my floors (hardwood and tile) about every other week, sometimes more as there are messes. I did test it out on my carpet, and it did well (1/2 inch pile), and it handles our rugs well.Battery Life - The battery life isn't great. The first two times I used this, it ""completed a job"" in an hour and successfully docked itself. Over the last several cleanings, it has not finished and ran out of battery after an hour and a half. I realize that running continually for that long drains batteries quickly, but I would expect it to finish the job in that time; our house isn't that large, after all.Cleaning Pattern - I don't understand the Roomba's cleaning pattern. Sometimes it cleans a space six times and not at all the next time. If I were to purchase another Roomba, I would splurge on one that maps out our space.Overall, I would absolutely buy another Roomba. I am pleased with its performance, but if I'm going to spend money on a product like this, I wouldn't skimp on the extra features again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9064566493034363

Not to mention some of the prices of these roombas even at costco is insane. I have to say they have completely dialed in all of the shortcomings that made the red roomba a terrible experience. The wheel is removable 100% the sweeper is about the same and easy to clean. the brushes are easy to clean. and the auto home feature and wifi app are suburb not to mention the lithium battery is very much welcomed after coming off nimh batteries.The single biggest problem with the original red one is the maintenance for every time they cleaned I'd spend about the same amount of time cleaning the robot. This new one is literally a 5 minute job pop out the brushes and the wheel remove the hair and pop it back in.If you're on the fence like i was for over 3 years trying to justify spending more on roombas this one is totally worth it. the house has never been cleaner and the amount of stuff it finds is shocking on a daily basis.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2019",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9973917007446289

No matter how many times I sweep or vacuum, my house has a constant layer of fur on the floor. My husband gave this to me for Christmas and I was absolutely amazed at how well it did.This little thing was designed by a genius. Instead of having a stiff-bristled brush, this brush is lush and soft. The dog fur wraps gently around it and is easily removed after each use. I used to have to cut the fur with scissors and pick and pull at it for ages to clean my so called ""pet friendly"" upright vacuum. In addition to making it easy to clear the dog fur, the soft bristle brush gathers the sand and dirt that gets tracked in, rather than spray it all over the room like a traditional, stiff-bristled vacuum.This vacuum is also much quieter than a traditional vacuum, which means it can run in the background even during zoom classes and online work.There are places it can't go (it gets stuck under the claw foot tub), and once a week I need to do a deep clean of the corners and other tight places, but all in all, this is a great labor saver. My 17 year old son even commented on how much cleaner the floors looked.

3.0 out of 5 stars,We have had this roomba for about 3 months and use it almost daily.  My original expectations was to have it running through various rooms while we were at work.  We quickly discovered that the roomba cannot be unattended.  I spend a lot of time getting it “unstuck” from various locations around the house. It does clean well but it’s not perfect.  My vacuum cleaner does a better job.  It does leave stuff behind but if you use it frequently it will eventually get the entire room.I run it daily in the kitchen because that is where the most activity and dirt occurs.  It does a wonderful job in there.  I alternate between rooms every day. We have pets and I have not noticed any pet hair accumulation since purchasing the roomba.  My floors are always clean and that saves me time in the long run.The roomba has the most difficult time in the living room because of more obstacles in there. It gets stuck underneath the couches and in between furniture and it is a pain to retrieve it.We use it upstairs in the bedrooms on the weekends and it does fine. Enviably it will die underneath our king size bed just out of arms reach.It does not find the docking station very well and rarely will return on its on.  I have to place it on there which is difficult to get it lined up perfectly.  I usually set it a few feet away and “send it home” so it will align itself on the station. Another issue I have recently encountered is it is having a hard time docking correctly.  It goes to the docking station but won’t attach to it.  I finally moved the docking station to a carpeted area because it seemed to work better on the carpet than the wood floor.Overall I am happy with the purchase.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this vacuum!  Previously owned a Samsung robot vacuum and it finally broke after several years.  I tried going without, but honestly, with two cats in the house it was tough.  Rather than dealing with furballs I decided to invest in a new one.Overall, this vacuum does a nice job. It transitions from carpet to hard floor quite well.  There have been some mishaps when it gets caught up on the stair ledge, but I am quickly noticed through the app that the terminator has a problem.  Which is nice.  I am hopeful in time it will learn to avoid that area.This was well worth the money and I have it set to run every day.  It runs for around 90 minutes and cleans the living room, bathroom, hallway and bedroom quite well.  It is not too noisy.It does require emptying after each run, but that is quite easy to do.  Set up was also a breeze with the WiFi.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9925156235694885
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface this review with saying I love my Roomba. It has saved me so much time from vacuuming. However, I was really hoping for something that you just leave and it vacuums multiple rooms on 1 charge. And that’s not what happens. It has a battery of about 1 1/2 hours which lasts for one large room. If there are multiple doors open, it usually gets lost and then can’t find its docking station to recharge and runs out of battery. What I do is put it in a room with the door closed. When it finishes that room, I pick it plus the docking station up, move it to another room, close the door, and it vacuums that room. So it takes me 2 to 3 days to vacuum our 3000 square-foot house because I have to move it from room to room and it eventually loses its charge and then needs at least an hour to fully charge. It does an amazing job though.","Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9987680912017822
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a combined garage and wood working shop.  The cars bring in dirt and grit, especially in the winter.  The wood shop generates dust and wood shavings.  If the shop is vacuumed, it is so much nicer to work in -- no lofting dust, no grit underfoot.  Over the years I have had three different robot vacuums.  This one is the best so far, but it gets stuck stupid places, like at the garage doors or behind a bin of wood shavings.  My other gripe is that when it has an issue it has a voice that instead of telling you the issue tells you to open an phone application.  It would be much better to say ""can't detect refuse bin"" than ""error 14.  Open the blah, blah, blah app"".  So far (5 months or so), this continues to work.  It *seems* like it will continue to work.Some background on previous vacuums.  I had a Roomba 410 years ago.  It got stuck less of fewer things, but didn't clean quite as well and would become completely disabled by an ash plane shaving.  After six or eight months, its gears had worn down to nubs due to the grit from the cars.  I managed to replace the main gear train, but it wore down again after a similar time, and I decided it wasn't worth the expense at that rate.After that, my brother gave me a Neato brand vacuum.  This is similar to the Roomba, but, instead of the random-walk vacuum pattern follows a satisfying back-and-forth pattern.  Unfortunately, as much as it was more pleasing to watch, it didn't do as good a job.  I had to run it three or four times to get the same quality of material pick-up as the Roomba 410 did in one pass.  Additionally, it is just a bit taller than the Roomba, which made it not fit underneath my lumber drying rack.  It got stuck about the same amount as the Roomba 410.  The batteries stopped holding a charge after 8 months or so.  I replaced them and the second set lasted vaguely half as long.  I replaced them again and that set lasted only a couple of months.  Additionally, at some point the bin sensor failed (so it never detected that the bin was in place), so I bypassed it with some solder.This Roomba (the 675) cleans in roughly the same random pattern as the 410.  It definitely picks up more and doesn't fail as badly on wood shavings or blown in leaves.  The battery life has been fine so far, and the gears look like they haven't worn too much so far.  I wish it didn't get stuck so often.","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9983112215995789
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing works ! I was very skeptical when I bit the bullet and bought it. I live in a cabin out in the smokey mountains and its just me and my dog. I'm pretty clean, but always building something or doing something outside. To lazy to pull on and off my work boots, and the dog always seems to be on the wrong side of the door. So she comes and goes like the weather. I usually try to vacuum when I get some down time, but hey, I'm a guy. So, I bought this thing, charged it up, picked up all my stuff on the floor, put the chairs up, moved all the loose items on the floor, dog bowl, cloths, trash cans, etc..

But, hey it was easier than me getting on my knees trying to hair ball and fuzzy stuff hunting. I ran it for about 3 day's carried it up stairs did all the prep, and Pow, it cleaned every nook and cranny. Went places I've never been. Cheaper than a maid, and not as vocal as my ex-wife.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great entry level robot vacuum. We use this to clean the hardwood and rugs in our living room and kitchen and it does a great job cleaning up all the cat and dog hair and all the dirt the pets bring in. The floors are spotless after it runs a full cycle. The Roomba app is great and you can easily set your cleaning schedule or start a new cycle while you're away. You do have to make sure any loose objects are off the floor, so as we leave for the day we take 2 minutes and move the pet food bowls and anything else up and out of the way. Same for any loose cords or curtains that are hanging on the floor.Knocking off one star because it sometimes sometimes freezes when it goes to far out over the ledge between our living room and family room that's one step down. 95% of the time it senses the ledge and turns around, but other times it goes too far out and gets stuck. You have to turn it around yourself and press start again to get it back running. It also sometimes get stuck under the couch. Our couch is just the right height that the Roomba can get under the couch in one certain spot, but then gets stuck. If it was a fraction taller or shorter, it would work just fine. It can be annoying when you expect it to clean the whole area, but get's stuck after just a few minutes of cleaning.It also seems to have a hard time finding it's docking station after it gets done cleaning. It's probably our fault in where we located the docking station, but this spot works for us and is out of the way. We just have to pick up the dead Roomba and carry it back to the dock. Not a huge deal, and the convenience of the robot vacuum outweighs the issue of having to carry it back when it's done.Due to the layout of our house, if it finds it's way into the bedrooms/office, it would usually get stuck back there, so we block off that area of the house now. We didn't feel like spending the large amount of extra money to buy a vacuum that comes with house mapping, so we still vacuum those areas with our cordless stick vacuum.If you're hoping this vacuum will clean your entire house and return to it's charging dock perfectly, you probably need to spend the extra money and buy one with mapping features. But, if you want a vacuum to thoroughly clean you main living areas and save a little money, this is the one for you.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9547759294509888

I will say this, it does a good job at actually picking up dirty, debris, and pet hair. In the 3 days of owning this turd, I’ve spent more time redirecting its path and helping it get unstuck from beneath tables and chairs. It seems to spend a lot of time cleaning the area around its docking station and when we repositioned it to another room, it always returns back to the room where it’s docking station is located. Setting it up was fairly easy and the app does offer complete control and cleaning schedules which is nice. We were really looking for a device that we could schedule to run over night while the family slept but, this wasn’t it; it sounds a tone when it begins cleaning which is unnecessarily loud to go along with the noisiness of the robot “clunking” around while it cleans.

Even on the hardwood and tile this little demon (her name is Rosie) is finding dog hair and dirt I couldn't see or feel! She makes me ashamed of myself for being so slack! Now consider the following when deciding if a Roomba is what you need:1. How many minutes do you vacuum a room per event? 5-7 minutes maybe?  Let this thing go for 30-60 minutes and see what it can do!2. Does your carpet get ""trained"" to lay one way or another? It will vacuum in multiple directions keeping your carpet honest and straight.3. When was the last time you swept under the bed or couch? Yeah. You'll clean out that bin several times in the first few runs.4. Wouldn't you rather be doing something else anyway?Bottom line and as I type it is doing it's thing.

Hasn't broken yet, but I always worry that it will.Also, the rollers are very high maintenance. This model has a rubber roller and a brush.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"We recently purchased 2 iRobot Roomba's to replace our dated Neato Botvacs.  At first I assumed the devices were doing a good job since their bins contained lint and other dirt particles.  However, after using them both for about 5 times each, I would like to offer the following feedback:1.  The Botvac in no way maps the house or attempts to run a strategic path.  It literally runs into everything at almost full speed, spins around, and goes in an entirely different direction.  Entire swaths of rooms are left untouched.  More importantly, it skips rooms all together.  It will spend an hour and a half cleaning one room before docking again.2.  The app is good for starting a job, but ignores the command to stop cleaning and return to base.3.  It will literally get stuck in a corner and never figure-out how to correct.  In fact, it gets stuck so much more than our Neato ever did.  You cannot leave the house, start a job, and expect it to finish without an issue.4.  It does not clean as well as our Neato used to.  It certainly gets the basics, but we always see missed debris that should have been caught during the cleaning.We had such a good experience with our Neato Botvacs that we were excited about switching to iRobot's version with wifi capabilities.

There was no arguing about his decision because we also rescued a Maltipoo 9 years ago, and he's been wanting a Sheppard.  Therefore, I  supported his decision because he's a great guy, and it helped that he gifted me Cartier love bracelets for my birthday - since  COVID ruined my 50th.  I digress.  ""Rambling Rose,"" the name we gave our Rhumba is a god-send! I have her scheduled every day to go on at 9 AM, and in about two hours, the entire house is hair-free.  She picks up mostly everything, but most importantly, she manages to get every last hair on the floor!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"For a robot, this thing is stupid. It misses lots of debris and spots on the floor while working. Haphazardly bumps around the room. Many times I just pick it up and place it where I want vacuumed and it still misses. It also has a hard time finding the dock although it's not in a hidden spot. The app is also useless for this model. It would appear that you can set different cleaning routines through the app, and thats not possible with this model. There is also no mapping for this model in the app, so unless you are watching the vacuum go through the house, you don't know where it goes. In this case, the well known name brand is NOT better. Save your money and get a different robovac.","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9997957348823547
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought the Roomba to replace my Neato because it got great reviews and was less expensive.  I have not been nearly as happy with it.  I do like that it connects to WiFi and I get an announcement via the app when a job has been completed or if he is stuck.  Many times I will come home from work and find him in the middle of the room rather than on the base.  He misses quite a bit, and even though I have a fairly small (2,400 sq ft) one-story home (and have three of the rooms closed off), he still doesn’t clean the entire area.  My Neato followed a straight path in open areas, but the Roomba is random and the carpet tracks he leaves are every which way.  In reading over the cleaning log in the app, I realized there are more days he gets stuck or doesn’t return to the base than he completes a cycle and returns for recharging.  He does not go back to the base, recharge, then finish; once he runs out of juice, he either stops right where he is Or returns to the base and stays there.  When I need to replace again, will go back to the Neato.

   I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife, and she was ecstatic about it! Sadly though, our excitement seemed to end there. I wanted to use it for at least two weeks before we left a review, so I could give a qualitative review. Three weeks into using it we found quite a few problems with the Roomba 675, and what was even more disappointing is how customer service was over the phone.1. The iRobot Roomba 675 claims it can transition from hard flooring to carpet/rug with ease due to its auto-adjusting cleaning heads and +Power boost technology. Sadly, this is not true. We have two rugs that are relatively short in fiber hight, and the Roomba 675 rarely gets onto them. At first, I thought that maybe we got a defective unit that just struggled to get over rugs and onto the carpet. After calling customer service, I was told that my carpet is over 1.6cm or 5/8in and that it cannot get over that height. After measuring my carpet, I found that my carpet is just under 1.6cm, which is supposedly within the hight limit. However, customer support concluded that I was wrong, and had no help or advice to offer me.2. The Roomba 675 claims that it has intelligent navigation. If you can call it running into walls and obstacles, then randomly changing directions intelligent navigation, then sure, its got it. Supposedly this also helps it ""navigate under and around objects and under furniture"", yet it CONSTANTLY gets stuck, under our fridge, under our couches, under our coffee table, and when it manages to get onto our rug.3. This unit was not made to last, which is why they sell replacement parts. We've been using the Roomba 675 for about three weeks now, and already the edge sweeping brush has broken. Sure, this is an easy fix and can be replaced for about $20, but that seems unreasonable to replace that often.4. The Roomba 675 claims that it automatically docs and recharges itself. Sadly, we've rarely seen this happen. If the Roomba 675 isn't within direct sight of its docking station, then it CANNOT find it. You'd think it'd use that ""intelligent navigation"" to remember where it has been and how to get back to its docking station, but it doesn't. From what I've noticed, it aimlessly vacumes and bumps into things, when its battery gets low, it seems like it searches for its dock, but usually cannot find it.5. Ultimately, we found that it can't clean deep or well enough to replace our normal vacuum, so we will still be doing that every week.To finish, if it was my choice, I'd return the Roomba 675 in a heartbeat, especially since it can't hold up to what it claims. But, my wife claims it's not a bad broom replacer... so if you want to give up sweeping, its got that going for it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.999559223651886

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Roomba 675 mostly because of pet hair.  My 30 pound long haired dog and 11 pound short haired cat are indoor pets, and they’re both good shedders.Roomba worked as advertised—scooted across my mostly-hardwood floors and didn’t have any trouble climbing onto my area rugs.  The best thing was that it zipped underneath the couch and beds, places that are harder for me to clean.  The worst part was hearing it blunder around in the forest of table and chair legs in the dining room, whacking into things, spinning, whacking again.  But it did find its way out!The dust cup was full—mostly fur—after half the house was vacuumed.  I set the Roomba loose in the bedrooms and the dust cup filled up again.  The front wheel and brushes were also clogged with fur after one trip around my house.  This takes a few minutes to remove, and your hands get dirty.  Tip: try a cheap plastic “rat-tail” comb to pull the fur out of the brushes.  It worked for me.After one use, the pluses were the ease of using this machine, and it was pretty good at getting up the fur.  Minuses: cleaning the brushes and emptying the dust cup as often as I did.  This model doesn’t show an indicator light for a full dust cup, you just have to check it.  Also, Roomba doesn’t do corners very well (or maybe at all).I’ll definitely keep it and it will be useful, but not a magic solution.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9921560883522034

You need to pickup everything including cords which is extremely annoying but if you don't, roomba will tangle itself and start dragging whatever is attached which will end up breaking things. It's already broken a mirror which ended up falling on the roomba and damaging it. Anything light, it will ram causing it to fall. It just goes around randomly which means it misses a lot of spots. It tends to obsess over certain spots, constantly trying to go back to the same spot and stay there while absolutely avoiding other areas and never cleaning there.It needs to be watched while it's on meaning I'm not saving any time having it vacuum. It's not noisier than a vacuum but I can vacuum faster and the roomba needs over an hour to actually clean so the sound gets pretty annoying.","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9996820688247681

I have hardwood floors and it tends to blow some of the dog hair around at first but eventually gets most of it. Not impressed with the front cliff sensor. If it goes at my stairs head on I will get the cliff warning and have to move the Roomba. But if it goes towards the stairs at an angle the side cliff sensors work great.This unit doesn't have do virtual mapping so it will run around, sometimes vacuuming a spot 5 or 6 times. It will continue cleaning until the dust bin is full (generally an hour and a half). I do wish it did virtual mapping so it wouldn't have to run so long each time but, doing the barefoot test afterwards I can tell that it did it's job.Overall for my first robotic vacuum I'm definitely happy with it.

Ruby works every day and she is so awesome at her job. She even cleans under my bed occasionally. With two dogs she finds enough hair to fill up every day. One of the best purchases I’ve ever made. The app is easy to use and with the exception of needing to robot-proof the house, this couldn’t be any better. I got to the point where I couldn’t find the time to vacuum my house even once a month. When I got Ruby, I had her run two or three times in the same day. She was full after each cycle. I did this probably two days in a row and then just ran her once a day for the remainder of two weeks. Then I pulled out my high-quality $300+ manual vacuum cleaner that I got as a wedding gift.  I was expecting to get find dirt and things that Ruby had missed because of lower section, but after slowly vacuuming my whole house there was almost no dirt in the canister.

We had 2 Neatos before this but they are extremely expensive now so we decided to give this one a try. The first few days were great but we noticed this thing doesn't follow a pattern. It's literally all over the place. The lines on the carpet make it look like the Roomba had too much to drink before work.Next issue is that you have to do quite a bit of work to keep this thing going. It's not just about cleaning the filter and the brushes. The hair makes it's way around EVERYTHING in this vacuum.  You have to take the front wheel off every couple of days. Because the hair clogs it so fast that it stops rolling. When you take the brushes out to clean them the hair isn't just around the brush, it's caked and stuck around the tiny parts that hold the brush in place and there is no easy way to remove it so you have to get scissors and start cutting itNext issue is that I can't get ours to charge without a daily fight. I don't know if the wheels aren't level or if ours is just defective but I have to slide something (usually a few pieces of mail to lift the back end of the roomba up so it will start charging because it cannot position itself in a way that it will charge without help. I've never had to work so hard on a robot vacuum.The plus side is that when it does work, it works well.Overall, I wouldn't recomend this to a friend. It's priced well but it never works right and takes daily maintenanceLet me also add that we've tried placing it in several areas of our house to make sure it just didn't need a better balance point to charge but none have worked. The photos I've added were taken about 2 days after taking it apart and cleaning all of those areas of hair. Our Neatos were made in a way that the hair couldnt get into any part but the brush and trash area so we had very little maintenance to do.

We have it scheduled to run 3 times a week, and I'd say it learned the layout of the apartment within the first 2 weeks. It cleans different sections of the apartment on different days, and gets into its groove more as time goes on, so you just have to trust its process at first.The only slightly annoying issue we've had with the Roomba is that once it starts running, the charge only lasts for an hour and fifteen minutes to ~maybe~ an hour and thirty minutes max. There have been 2 or 3 times where it's just died while cleaning, or died while on its way back to the dock, and then I've had to go grab it and place it on the charging dock manually. However, it is a ""robot vacuum"", and so I think you need to expect it to have dumb moments like this sometimes.You have to keep floors fairly clean of small objects to, or else the roomba may get stuck on top of them - I've had it get stuck on my laptop cord, and then again, you have to go manually untangle the cord and move the roomba to get back on track.Regardless, the Roomba purchase was well worth the money for me - I hate vacuuming, and this has saved me the trouble of adding it to my to-do list. The noise is slightly quieter than that of a manual vacuum, too, so that's an added plus. Maybe one of the best features is the app compatibility. The push notifications on the phone alert you if the Roomba is stuck on something, or if the battery is running low, and you can choose to send it home if needed.All around, I'd recommend this purchase to a friend.

I also have 4 cats and 1 dog and have been a bit paranoid about the horror stories I've read. Once it was delivered, I proceeded to unpackage it. Quick instructions on setting this up. I let it charge (which took less time than the instructions stated). Once it was charged, I set up the house with ""barriers"" in places I didn't want it to go. Shut the door to the mud room so it didn't go in there and then started it up.Off it went like a drunk uncle during Christmas dinner. It was banging into everything all over the place. I chalked it up to the learning phase. But boy, oh boy, did it remind of the drunk uncle stories. You know, that uncle that gets drunk during family gatherings, but everyone still loves. From this point on, I decided it needed a drunk uncle name. Mine is called uncle Otis.Uncle Otis went to town on my house. So much that I didn't think he was going to make it back before the battery ran out. On the app, I told it to go dock. Uncle Otis (like a typical drunk uncle) didn't really listen and just kept on cleaning. I think he finally staggered home, but barely. I really was not expecting uncle Otis to actually clean as well as my regular vacuum. I have an expensive Kirby vacuum and couldn't imagine this little guy could outdo it. I also had vacuumed previous to getting this just to give the poor guy a chance. To my surprise, the container was chalk FULL of animal hair and debris. I couldn't believe it, but uncle Otis was able to get a deeper clean than my expensive, fancy vacuum.Day two: I started uncle Otis up. Still banged into a bunch of things, but not as hard this time. I guess he finally started get some lay of the land. Poor guy was also going into nooks and crannies I couldn't reach with my regular vacuum. I think he became friends with a spider under my entertainment center. He came out fully decorated in spider silk... Only catch today was that he tried to get under the coffee table and got stuck. Had to free him and start him back up. Off he went again. After he was done cleaning, I emptied him. The container was 3/4 full of hair and debris. Man, uncle Otis is a beast!Day three: I gave uncle Otis the day off.Day four: I was working from home, so I started him up and went upstairs to work. I swear, about every 10 minutes, uncle Otis was stuck under the coffee table again. I finally let him have his way and raised the coffee table with some wood blocks. Uncle Otis was happy he could get under there. Still a decent amount of hair and debris after the run. I'm not sure, but I think uncle Otis is trying to mess with me. Either that, or my animals are filthy!Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase. Uncle Otis does a great job vacuuming. He hasn't had any problem transitioning from carpet to hardwood floors to rugs. I even braved taking him upstairs to clean. I was a bit concerned about him stumbling down the stairs, but he was great at stopping before the great tumble. It is a bit scary, as he does head toward the edge at a pretty fast speed. But he never once tumbled.He still picks up a ton of hair and debris. This actually makes me happy as that is nasty that I could be breathing. And it's wonderful having a happy little robot that can vacuum while I do something else.Every once in a while, he has his ""moments"".

In that, the Roomba does really well, especially using the app to keep it on a schedule through the week so it gets a quick cleaning in while I’m at work. However, I will admit that there are some issues.It’s not the most powerful vacuum out there. If you’re expecting a deep cleaning every time the Roomba starts up, I think you’re going to be disappointed. Also, yes, the Roomba will occasionally get stuck. I’ve gotten notifications that he’s fallen off a cliff, gotten stuck, gobbled up something he shouldn’t have, etc. Some of this is on me, and I forgot to pick up a cable or napkin or what have you. Some of it is my furniture and my Roomba will find a way underneath and then not be able to get out. Also, he does bang into everything, that’s just what Roomba’s do as they clean. If you’re worried about marks on furniture, that’s something to be aware of. I’ve found that a soft foam strip on the bumper will solve the bumping problem, and the iRobot Virtual Wall kits will help keep the Roomba away from areas that he might get stuck in. Is that an added expense? Sure. Is it a deal breaker? I don’t think so, especially since a self mapping Roomba 960 is over $500 and the Virtual Wall kits are about $35 a pop.If you’re expecting your Roomba to keep your home completely spotless and never get hung up on something, I can say at the very least this isn’t the Roomba for you. If you’re willing to get a Roomba that will do fine maintenance cleanings with relatively few problems, and be willing to do a deeper vacuuming once in a while and/or set up some virtual walls to manage issues here and there, this one will do you fine.","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9836243987083435

1.0 out of 5 stars,Well to start off what I like about the vacuum is that it is compact and has good suction for it size. But the negative just outweigh the positives. So what I dislike about is that it constantly gets stuck on every little thing. Second for cleaning it does not do a good clean I had a Chinese brand which was a few bucks more but he did such an amazing job that he would not mess a lot of dirt and pieces. The last thing that I dislike about it is how fast it goes with disregards to sensing what’s around and so it will get scratched at the top very fast just by getting underneath cabinets and other items because ages rams into items in your house. I don’t write many reviews but I feel like I had to write this review I was deeply disappointed with this purchase and will be returning this item maybe I can try one out there better models which are twice or three times the price but that defeats the point of having an affordable robotic vacuum.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9769815802574158

Yep.I got this because I have a cat and a toddler who manage to destroy my floor every day & my toddler hates when there is any piece of dirt on her feet so having help keeping the floors clean is a life saver.This robot will get stuck if you don’t make a few adjustments around your house before you set it to work. This allows you to be a certain level of lazy but not completely teenager level lazy.If you’re neurotic about your floors and think this is going to make them spotless, get a more expensive version.This is perfect for an average person who wants to keep dirt off their bare feet and dust from accumulating in the corners and under stuff.","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9949328303337097

It works better than my old vacuum and I don't have to do anything but get out of the way, usually. Had I known how much I would love it I would have sprung for one that empties itself and doesn't seem to randomly bounce off my walls, it hits every spot though.I've only used it about ten times and it seems fantastic so far but I am a single person with no kids or pets so I don't have much to clean up. My only issues that I didn't know about before purchasing are minor and some are specific to my household:1. One time it wasn't able to find it's way back to the charging station before it died. My apartment is narrow with a bunch of turns and it got stuck on the wrong side for too long near the end. 2. It is probably capable of climbing on my bathroom floor mat but the sensor doesn't allow it to. 3. I've had some issues using the scheduler on the app. It changed PM to AM on the schedules I've tried to save so far, I was able to change them again to get them to save as PM though. It is also weird that you have to set a time for each specific weekday and can't do a recurring event like daily or every other day. 4. My refrigerator is just the right height that it can get a little bit underneath it but one time it got stuck when trying to turn back out.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9724655747413635

It can work/run manually if you press the  CLEAN button.

   Well, I sure like the idea of a robot vacuuming for me but I have 3 dogs and 3 cats so I get a fair amount of pet hair in a weeks time. I have all vinyl flooring except an area rug in the living room and a few rugs at the doors. What I saw was the robot picks up some of the hair and dirt that is not blown around by the robot but it got itself stuck under a piece of furniture and could not get back up on the rug which is a large, 10'x 14', synthetic, short fiber carpet with no padding under it. When I did get it to vacuum some of the carpet it left the area still looking like it needed to be vacuumed.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have a blind dog and so far, from two cleanings, I am pretty sure if we attached a vaccuum to him and let him wander around the house, it would probably be a lot like watching the roomba work.  Lots of seeming aimlessness and bumping into things.  The roomba is also kind of loud.  Not unpleasantly so but is louder than I imagined.  And so far, during both cleanings the roomba has gotten caught up on the legs of our recliner which is apparently what it imagines hanging off a cliff to be like because that is the error message I get.  Now.  Let me tell you why you should ignore all that and buy this anyway.Now, I don't want to overstate this but basically, 'The Tiger King' on Netflix changed our life.  Our 13 year old daughter just randomly now blames EVERYTHING on Carole Baskin.  So, when we got the Roomba, she was DELIGHTED to know we could name it.  Guess what she named it? Yep.  Now, ""...that b*tch, Carole Baskin"" doesn't fit in the spaces allowed so we did have to settle for ""Carole Baskin"".  This name was chosen because we have four cats and ""Carole""  just goes around cleaning up cat hair.This is important because when you setup your Roomba, you need to download an app so you can schedule, name and manage your Roomba.  When your Roomba gets ""caught up on a cliff"" like recliner legs in our case, your app will alert you that your Roomba requires assistance.  For example, my alerts look something like, ""Carole Baskin is caught on a cliff.  Please relocate Carole Baskin...""My daughter HOWLS over this.At this point, being in quarantine and in a home that takes that VERY seriously, if this thing did not work for crap, I would still give it a 5 star rating. The hilarity and entertainment is just worth the money at this point, honestly.However, that being said, ""Carole"" works AMAZINGLY well.  As I said, four cats across approximately 1,500 sq. ft. of our first floor (of a 2 story home) 24-7 is a lot to keep up with and I routinely feel overwhelmed by the upkeep.  Our floors are SO clean!

We have mostly tile and hardwood floors throughout and she cruises through rooms and over general rugs such as bathmats and area rugs with ease. She's ""learning"". Day 1 she had her work cut over for her. We found she got tangled up in our floor-length curtains, but to be fair, they do gather a bit on the floor. Not her fault. The first day she made it back to her docking station w/out issue; day 2+ we haven't been as successful as her battery died before she made the full return trip. I personally don't mind; I have to seek her out to empty the bin anyway. But each day she is scheduled to run, the bin is full when the cycle is complete. It's almost conerning how much is picked up by ""Rosie"" on a regular basis.  You do need to apply some common sense and manage your expectations. She's not a housekeeper. If objects are left on the floor, such as shoes, toys, etc. she's going to clean around them.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Disclaimer: I bought this model, 675, with my own money and these are my honest opinions.I've never owned one of these and literally bought it on a whim. I was initially looking at a cheaper Eufy brand vacuum because I trust its parent company (Anker), but once I saw that iRobot had Alexa enabled and app integrated robots I went for this one. A lot of my house consists of smart devices so it only made sense.The Alexa integration was very simple. Just download the app, log into your wifi, and the Roomba connects very easily. Then you just have to enable the iRobot Home skill in your Alexa app. I had trouble figuring out the appropriate commands but just google search ""roomba alexa comands"" to find them. Once you set up scheduled cleaning in the iRobot app you don't have to control it through Alexa very often unless you want to do multiple cleanings in a day.I placed the dock appropriately, following spacial instructions, and charged the robot for about an hour. The instructions say 3 hours initially but I checked the app and it was fully charged. The Roomba responds very quickly to the app and it started cleaning right when I tapped ""Clean"" on the app. It moves very randomly and can seem to get stuck for a bit but it usually finds its way. I have an area rug with dark brown/black sections that I wasn't worried about but it will not pass over them because it assumes they're ""cliffs."" I'm grateful for the ""cliff protection"" feature and can live with this hiccup, just beware if you have black rugs. I have others that are solid chocolate brown and it passes over those just fine.I was frustrated that it wouldn't return to base the first couple times, but that's because I moved it manually because it couldn't find its way out from under my dining table and I was inpatient. IF YOU MOVE IT DURING CLEANING IT CAN'T FIND THE BASE. It will only find its way back to the dock it it starts there and is left uninterrupted. Occasionally it will actually get stuck and it will turn off and chime some tones to get your attention. You also get a notification on your phone to go help it. The only times it's gotten really stuck was on the edge of a really high pile shag rug (which is warned against in the instructions) and when it wedged under a headboard that was just the perfect height to pin it to the ground.Some have said it sucks up cords but I keep my cords/electronics VERY tidy so its not an issue for me. Emptying the bin is very easy, and it filled up really quickly the first few runs, which is expected. Its kind of gross how much it captures in my house because I keep it very clean as it is. It was able to pick up standard clay cat litter fairly well. Toward the end of its cleaning cycle when the bin and filter were more obstructed it didn't always capture the litter though, which is what you'd expect. It did bump into my cats' food and water bowls and push them around a bit. It worries me a little that water may spill if I'm not there to monitor it. I've ordered a ""iRobot Dual Mode Virtual Wall Barrier (Renewed)"" that i'll put in ""Lighthouse"" mode to fix that (the renewed model is half the price of a new one so I'm giving it a shot. it has a 90 day amazon guarantee).Overall I love this thing and it's only been 2 days. It's very convenient to be able to schedule cleaning when your away at work, or if you are expecting company and have other things to prepare. I think my Roomba will continue to serve me well. If any glaring issues come up I'll update this review as needed.UPDATE 9/19/19I still love the thing. I ordered some white felt tape and put that over the black borders of my trouble rug under my couches so it seamlessly travels over those areas. I also ordered 8 2"" risers for my couch and loveseat because they were just barely too low for the roomba. The iRobot virtual walls (Renewed) are a life saver. I have 3 of them now, one to protect the cat food bowls, one to block off the dining room (it gets caught in the chair legs forever and would rather it spend time in other areas), and one to block off a room with a high pile shag rug.I've officially ""roomba-proofed"" my house and I have it clean everyday while I'm at work and I havent gotten a ""Roomba is stuck"" notification since.

I bought one after much research because I wanted one that was cheap, but would clean German Shepherd hair and Cat Litter off of hard wood floors. I would love to afford a $1400 model or even a $500 competitor model with LIDAR guidance. $200 is what I picked up this model for.I let the roomba clean one room at a time. After each room, I clean it out. I remove all the hair and debris that I can. The newer, smarter roombas, also had a brush redesign. They use two rubber brushes. The model here and the one I got has one rubber brush and one bristle brush.The dog hair is picked up very well and gets everywhere. In the brushes, the wheels , etc. I was not bothered by this. It is easy to remove. I take the dog brush I got, brush the bristle brush, and the hair comes right off. Roomba makes a tool but any pet hair brush does the same thing.I live in a dusty area as well. It is amazing how much dirt and debris the Roomba picks up, that you can't see. I've been more than thrilled. You may have to do some slight cleaning around the edges of the room if you are a super clean freak. I've never let the Roomba run until it has run out of battery. It goes to the dock automatically before it does. Or it is suppose to.I was happy how easily it navigated over wires. I prefer to pickup all wires or block off areas to them. I block access to other rooms with trash cans or chairs. Doesn't need a heavy object. If the roomba touches something it turns around. No need to buy the virtual barriers.If you're expecting to buy this, drop it in your nasty house, and work miracles... it won't happen.

The registration and connection process is slow and glitchy. If you registered a TV or game console or cell phone you might think setting up a cleaning robot is no big deal. Its actually much harder. The app also asks for your location. I don't think that's necessary.Secondly its very annoying to watch it clean. I had the impression that the roomba had some sort of radar or memory so it would actually clean up on a grid system. It does not. It bounces from wall to wall cleaning the same area over and over. It seems to purposely do things to annoy you like take a left to clean the same part of the room rather than a right to get into the dirty corner. Also it does not seemlessly move around obstacles.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK... so if you know that it works like a ping pong ball, then you understand, that it isn't smart. But the algorithm is pretty effective, and though it wont get every inch every time, you keep emptying the dirt that you didn't have to look for, and after the job, the house looks picked up. We have 1.7K square feet of hardwood floors , and if you don't keep up with it, it will show crumbs and dog hair. The best use, is the dust bunnies underneath the bed. Yes you can buy cheaper, but if you have to get maintenance parts, getting a Roomba is the way to go. If you're the overly picky get the more expensive mapping model you can order into different rooms, or self empty. This model takes a bit of stewardship, to plan for the job, pick up throw rugs, and anything that will bind it. If you have a maze of a house, you need to limit it's running area, or pause and pick it up. If you have an open concept with fewer obstacles, you'll have the best results.  If you want one and don't take care of your stuff, buy cheaper competitors. This model works as advertised. One problem with the base and docking is that the tires will get glazed with dust, and you need to wipe them occasionally. Another suggestion is to put sponge or ""Magic Eraser"" behind the dock, to absorb the push and reduce side-ward motion. We have a Persian cat, and you must clean the rollers and the ball roller in the front. It's easy enough to do, but no robot is impervious to pet hair,  if you are buying it to pickup after your long haired animal, you will have more maintenance, or you will have all sorts of running issues, and battery life issues (because the hair binds the wheels) People expect R2D2, and it ain't that.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9246563911437988

I don’t have anything positive to say other than it does “ok” with sweeping/vacuuming the floor. We had a Shark robot vacuum before and we will be going back to Shark when this Roomba dies or I murder it in cold blood... whichever happens first (likely the latter)!  It’s extremely loud... like you can’t have it in the same room if you’re planning to talk, watch tv, listen to music, nap, Jack hammer, whatever... it’s REALLY LOUD. If you value the look of your furniture, this ones not for you. The robot smashes into the legs on the furniture, slowly chipping away at the wood, like an axe to a tree. It has ripped the wood floor transition pieces off (more than once) that are liquid nailed to the subfloor. Roomba gets stuck multiple times during its cleaning cycle, cannot find the dock on its own and often doesn’t charge, even when hand placed on the dock. Would I recommend... hard no!This thing is likely to become a moving target for practice while I exercise my 2nd amendment right.A much cheaper Shark robot blew this Roomba away.

It's mapping doesn't seem very efficient, missing the same spots time after time.  I noticed that it would run over it's own home base during every clean cycle and the unit would simply stop in the middle of whatever it was doing after about an hour and a half.  When asked to dock, the unit either wouldn't, or it would roll over to the home base, run it over, then take off in a random direction.I talked to iRobot support, which was incredibly helpful.  They responded by email quickly and walked me through as many steps as possible to resolve the issue.  They then requested a phone call, which was quick and very helpful.  They used a neat streaming feature to watch what the unit would do when asked to dock.  Without much hassle, they sent me a new base unit very quickly (1 or 2 days later).  Unfortunately, the problem continued unchanged, even after performing a factory reset.Given that my concern seems pretty common, and issues like the inefficient mapping (if it was mapping the room at all, given that it would run over it's own base), I decided to return the unit to purchase a different one from another reputable company.I've used iRobot Roombas before, but they were all older units.  When I'm in the market for a higher end model, I would definitely consider another iRobot, but I can't recommend this one.  +1 star for excellent customer support.","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9885401129722595

If you don’t clean the brushes each session you won’t get a good clean, the brushes are not sturdy enough to maintain their shape with hair on them. This is a cute gadget that will pick up surface things for about 120 days then it no longer even does that. The side brush, which is critical for edging around hardwood floors, stopped working. This makes the floor look like it was never vacuumed. The carpet has a nice pattern making it appear clean. When I ran my real vacuum over it after a session my real vacuum filled with dirt and dust.

Instead of going in a logical pattern to clean the area, it goes in a straight line right off the area rug, and continually navigates to a small hallway area (3x5 feet) by my garage and will stay there for like 15 min. It will then come out, only to go back and stay there for another 10 min.The whole purpose of this product is to not have to worry about cleaning, and I found myself spending more time moving it to areas I actually needed cleaning than if I just cleaned the area myself.Save yourself $270 and buy a broom or a much less expensive vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9996820688247681
5.0 out of 5 stars,"“Roberta” has her moments. On carpet it does very well, on hard wood not so much. It tends to leave stuff behind, will go over little messes and not pick up and single thing. One thing about it is it’s great at picking up pet hair. It has a tendency to go in circles or hit up the same area multiple times. Not very good at docking itself but it’s super useful that you can control it from the app or through Alexa, I just usually have to manually dock it. It will easily get wrapped up in cords like phone chargers or a sock my 5 year old shoved under his bed.

Would never have bought this if I'd read about this in any of the reviews....in my opinion there isn't much point in using the Roomba (and having paid for it) if I'm going to have to lug out the regular vacuum to finish the job and get the rugs clean (and they need vacuumed the most as they are in the kitchen).","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2019",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9992488622665405

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I dreamed of owning a Roomba since I first saw one. Finally, I decided I would trade the suction and cleaning power of a real vacuum for the convenience of the Roomba. Unfortunately, it's the most useless piece of garbage on Earth. It cannot even finish a cleaning cycle.Oh, don't get me wrong. It often thinks it does. Because it's useless. Right now it thinks it has finished the job, because it's done most of my bedroom. The rest of the apartment is up to me, I suppose.This may be because of how difficult it is for the Roomba to actually do any cleaning. Originally, the plan was that I could take the dog for walks while Roomba cleans. But that's not possible because about every 90 seconds I need to move it. Roomba thinks it's near a cliff. It's not. Usually it's just sitting on hardwood floor. One time there was a small, half centimeter bump in the rug. That was Kilimanjaro to this useless robot.Now, you may be thinking ""I'm sure his cleaning needs are much more than mine."" Oh, but they're probably not. I have a 700 square foot apartment with no steps, and only a small carpet and one rug. Roomba still can't clean my place.Reluctantly, I gave my dream purchase one star. I gave it a second star because if the geniuses behind iRobot are any indication, we will never have to worry about robots taking over the world.UPDATE: I've included photos of things that are too difficult for Roomba to handle. Both of these Roomba could not handle as it was ""near a cliff"" requiring me to manual move it. The former you can clearly see the MASSIVE drop off from the rug to the floor. The second, it's difficult to tell because, yes, it looks perfectly flat, but that's deceiving. There's a slight bump in the rug!! Honestly I don't understand how I don't trip over it constantly. No vacuum, particularly not one that I paid a not insignificant sum for, could possibly handle a slight bump in a rug. I've limited the photos to two of the - no exaggeration - THIRTEEN times Roomba encountered an error on this one area rug and I have to pick it up, move it, and restart. What a great purchase! Thanks, iRobot!SECOND UPDATE: After months of just getting used to how horrible Roomba is, I finally have lowered my review to one star. After painstakingly cleaning my area rug by hand, I have returned it's vibrant black color which it had lost due to dust and dirt and doghair. Now, Roomba can't cross it! Apparently, the darkness makes its sensors think it's a cliff. iRobot's helpful solution is to purchase virtual walls from them so Roomba won't go on my rug. Yes, that's correct. They want me to give them MORE MONEY so that their vacuum won't even attempt to vacuum.I've been an adult for 20 years, and have bought a lot of stuff. I've bought a lot of great things. I've bought a lot of mediocre things. And I've bought a lot of useless crap. I have NEVER bought anything I hate more than the iRobot Roomba. It is, easily, the worst piece of electronics I've ever owned. The used Betamax tape player I had as a kid was more advanced. I suppose you could buy one for someone you desperately hate in the most passive aggressive move ever.

If you have a lot of pets , keep after robot maintenance re brushes and bearings ( pick the hair off) and empty the bin but you have to do that with a regular vacuum cleaner too.","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2018",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9906092882156372
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this yesterday for my wife for Christmas (yes.. she asked for it lol). Setup of iRobot home app was a little tricky in regard to getting the phone and roomba connected to WiFi. This roomba ONLY connects to 2.4ghz WiFi for setup. Once it’s set up you can go back to dual 2.4/5.0 WiFi. Spent about an hour trying to figure out why it wouldn’t connect to WiFi and then noticed that the “VPN” setting was turned on on my phone (which will block the roomba / app from initial connection), once I turned this off the roomba setup worked fine. Ran it this morning to see how it worked and what possible trouble spots we’d have for it getting stuck. Flooring is a mix of tile, high and low pile rugs. Roomba handled tile and low pile rugs with no problem. It treated high pile rugs like “obstacles” which is what I hoped for. Took it about an hour to do entire lower level (about 1500sq ft). Didn’t get stuck once and maneuvered through many things I thought would stop it (chair legs, coffee table legs etc) although it takes a while for it to find the way in and out of those spots, it did. It could not find the home base until I moved it closer but I believe that is because of where I have it. I will move it to a more open area and test again. Initial run looks promising. Support for WiFi / app needs more detail.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9992968440055847
1.0 out of 5 stars,"While this Roomba does clean when it is running, it uses no logic to decide where it will clean. Ours will try to get under a coffee table over and over until it gets stuck. We move it our from under the table and place it in another area and it will return to the coffee table and get stuck again. This happens over and over, every day until we send it back to the dock. I have cleaned it thoroughly on a regular basis so this is not a sensor issue. We have had this one for a year now and it has reduced the vacuuming that we need to do...as long as it doesn't get stuck, which is not very often.  Some days it comes off the dock and goes straight to the same coffee table or kitchen shelf that it can't go under, tries over and over until it is wedged underneath, and then stops because it is stuck. The 675 has no logic to how it cleans. I have considered buying an I3 but worry that it will have the same issues.  We have two virtual walls that keep it from running out an open slider door and out of the guest rooms. These work fine but I don't want to have to buy 4 or 5 of them to place all around the house where the 675 gets stuck. Just beware if you are not going to use this in a single room with no possible low cabinets or shelves where it can get stuck, it will work fine. If you do have low cabinets, don't use this one.","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9992420077323914

Firstly the vacuum is so loud, like I can hear it over my noise cancelling headphones loud, and it will clean for over an hour, so if you are in the house, be prepared for that. Secondly, it is really really stupid. iRobot claim it has all these sensors, but it ends up so often just raming itself into places and getting stuck, spinning around and around in the middle of an open room for no reason. I was watching it try and get through a doorway on its last clean and it took 20 minutes for it to figure out that it needs to go through the big gap, not just ram itself into the door frame, turn around, drive back 2 metres and then do the exact same thing. I also have had to just lift it up and put it on its charging dock several times as it spends so long searching for it, despite driving centimetres past the dock several times while it searches. Twice (in the one month I have owned it), it has ran out of battery searching for its home base (its home base is in a clear and open location the middle of my hallway). The Eufy I had previously seemed much smarter than this, and A LOT quieter.

   So I got this robot vacuum for a 500+ ft studio. Obviously the studio has a good number of furniture articles in it. The robot cleans good enough to remove hair and dust, but not without my assistance. I need to remove articles from the surface so that it can do its job. Not super convenient when I was hoping to schedule an auto-cleaning on a daily basis, because every time I have to move the chair, etc. up the coffee table, etc. Nor does it clean the area rug; it gets stuck when it gets accidentally up on the rug and awaits me to put it down. Most importantly... it does not know when to stop cleaning. I let it run its course one day and it ran for 1 hour 49 minutes until it got tangled with a cable. The room is already clean but it doesn't go back to the dock on its own. Perhaps the robot was made with one bedroom plus in mind, so it gets screwed up when it is put to work in a studio. All in all... yes it is better to have a robot to clean the room for you, but be mindful that it is not completely independent.

We call it the drunk college student because it wanders around pretty aimlessly and does not seem to have any system to how it cleans. That being said, it does suck up a fairly impressive amount of first and dog hair (i have 2 medium sized dogs). If you have pets or don’t run it every day, you have to empty it halfway through the cleaning cycle to make sure it keeps cleaning effectively. The brushes accumulate quite a bit of hair, but they’re easy enough to take out and clean (or replace if needed).I was hoping I could program it so it can run while I’m at work, but it fits under some pieces of furniture just enough to get stuck and needs rescued, so that’s not an option for me.

I read reviews that the 675 is better with dog hair compared to others in their 900's series so that was honestly a deal breaker for me. Cleaning / emptying it after it runs is also super easy. Personally, we didn't want to put tape on the ground so I liked that we didn't have to with this. It has gotten stuck on the bathroom rugs so before we run it, I just shut the bathroom doors - not a big deal. But the cons.. The biggest is it's so loud!

The shaft of the side brush motor gets easily wrapped and filled with hair which is tough the clean out, contributing to the motor module breakage issue.  The shafts of the bottom brush and beater also get twisted up with hair and are a pain to clean off.  The thing gets hung up quite easily by furniture, edges of area rugs, refrigerator, etc.  I feel like we are constantly rescuing it from situations.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay so most importantly, this vacuum DOES NOT VACCUUM ON SHAG CARPET.We had a Shark originally that worked well but died on us. After doing some research decided to spend the extra money and try out the Roomba. I specifically chose this one because of it’s bragging about how great it is for transitioning to carpet from hard floor. What they fail to mention is that it will not make that transition if your carpet or rug is a shag material. The roomba would hit the carpet and turn around as if it’s an obstacle. I attempted to place the roomba on the carpet myself, where it then acted as if it was having a tough time being on the surface and did everything it could to get back to hard floor.I called and spoke to support, because I thought surely something was wrong with our vaccuum, and after speaking with a very kind support person and sharing multiple video calls so they could see exactly what was going on, it was confirmed that the issue was because it was shag carpet and “the roomba does not work on shag”.Needless to say, we returned it and received a refund.The vacuum worked great on our hardwood and did seem to be more intuitive than our shark in general, so I really wanted to keep it and be pleased with it, but our shark had no problem getting up on our shag carpet so we will be going back to it.Also, be aware that this Roomba seemed to have an issue with dark rugs as well, because the sensors would think it was “on a clif”.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9969240427017212

I stopped using it around 1.5 months ago when I realized it wasn't being effective. I just tried it again today, and I am so irritated by how terrible of a product this is that I felt the urge to write this review.Honestly, this product sucks (and not in a good way). I haven't even had it that long, and I just want to put it in the trash. There is a spining arm that stopped working very quickly. It gets stuck on all kinds of stuff and does repetitive motions, so it appears to clean the same part of the room over and over again. The hair gets caught up in the brush, I constantly clean out the brush, but it's not enough. Today, it appears to not even be actually sucking up anything. The little tray that holds dirt is literally empty and it's been running for 20 minutes. This is not worth the money. I want my money back. I tried to return it, but the return window closed. It's the worst. Don't buy it.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Roomba does fine and the app is reasonably convenient.  Out of the box it constantly gets stuck under furniture, but with the addition of some rubber bumpers added to the top that make the rest of the Roomba the same height as the sensor at the front this is no longer an issue.The primary issue I face are the cliff sensors.  The sensors trigger any time the unit tries to go up on brown rugs (light or dark).  I live in a one story home with 0 risk of it falling off a cliff.  iRobot should allow users to turn off these sensors.  The only options available right now are either to take the unit apart and alter the sensors manually or use aluminum foil or some other reflective material to cover the sensors, but this is frustrating to set up and requires maintenance as the taps and foil wear from bumping into things.  This has been a complaint since Roomba came out.  Users deserve to be able to toggle this on and off depending on the layout of their homes.Out of the box my Roomba delivered false positives of being stuck on a cliff when really it was just going over a rug and when the sensor goes off and causes it to back up it can often trap it in an area that uses its battery life very inefficiently.Compared to other units that I would not mind letting run while I was on a work conference call this one is extremely loud.  I'd recommend only running when you are out of the house, but out of the box it needs constant manual intervention to keep it running. our time is better spent using a more powerful upright vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9038822650909424

Everyone who comes over is impressed by it and usually ends up purchasing their own.

He weaves through the chair legs and under tables to pick up every crumb and spec of dirt.... places normal vacuums don't easily go  Sure, his pattern may seem a bit random, but he gets it done and the floors look great every time!When we moved from our last house, I noticed all the dust that had accumulated under the beds where we couldn't vacuum.  As I look back on my allergies, I wonder if some of it wasn't because of all the difficult places where dust hides.  Now that Bob is on the job, the areas under the beds gets vacuumed regularly, just like the rest of the carpets and floors.I researched lots of different models and manufacturers before purchasing this specific model.  Many had more features,bells & whistles, but seemed to have mixed reviews.  The Roomba 675 is a solid performer with all the features we need and the dependability we wanted.  After 3 months of use, it gets the floors clean every time and doesn't have any problems (other than a wooden base on a rocker which traps it occasionally.

If you're a single person living alone in a small apartment with no long hair or pet hair floating around, it may be a good option. But for almost everyone else, especially if you're specifically getting a roomba because you have a pet, I would recommend upgrading at least to the E5, which has silicone brushes and doesn't get stuck and tangled like this one.

The people that are complaining with one star reviews are mad because they have to adjust it here or there as if they want it to do everything for them I wouldn't be surprised if they expected the Roomba to cook for them or read tree kids a bedtime story. but there are a few minor issues that are not a big deal at all. It can get stuck on uneven surfaces. for example we have a table that has support bars on the floor and obviously if it tries to roll up on that it could get stuck but it will notify you through the app and you can go and readjusted and let it keep cleaning. so what we do is we put a laundry basket in the way so it doesn't get caught in that area. Other than that we do have indoor dogs that use potty pads so we just make sure to clean that up beforehand and remove the potty pads so that it doesn't try to suck those up. You definitely don't want your Roomba rolling through a pile of dog poop because it'll smeared across the floor. It's an extremely huge help with dog hair, kids glitter, and dirt that gets tracked in through our daily routines. This is a great product and I 100% recommended. But of course there are small issues that could be fixed that's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that I'm completely satisfied with it.

He is a bit noisy but I run him in the evening time right before I go to bed. I set up a schedule on the app and haven't got used to the time because I do get startled for a second when he comes on. I haven't ran him while away yet because he did get stuck a couple times. I do recommend decluttering your areas before starting a cleaning. I tend to pull out dining room chairs and pick up larger items like shoes first. I do have to remember to empty the bin before the next cleaning though. I also do notice that I have to sweep still in areas like under cabinets where he doesn't have enough clearance but not enough to not use him. The setup was super easy. I did have to figure out where the best place to put the dock as I didn't have enough clearance in the spot I originally was going to put him. He does tend to repeat certain areas but I try to ignore him and let him do his thang. Oh and my dog is not quite sure what to make of him and is annoyed with having to find a new laying spot when Wall-E comes around. But glad he's not barking at it otherwise I'd have to find a new home for the dog..lol jk,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9976190328598022

I have dark baseboards, so I can not speak to it leaving marks, I will say it can move light chairs around with the force it runs into things.I haven't had to fix anything, but they do sell new parts for this thing, all the motor driven parts, which is better than most actual vacuum cleaners out there.Bottom line, for under 180 bucks your house will be clean, and you just have to empty the bin.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021",3 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9499589204788208

The reason i did not give this product a single star is that the software is good, where the unit goes it does clean well, the battery life in the limited time i had it was good. The cons are out of over 12 tries it only returned to base twice. Most of the time it would just run until the battery was dead and stop where it was. It would do this even when i saw the battery was low and instructed it to return to base. Other times it would get stuck even when there was no compelling reason seen. To me the reason to purchase this is to perform a task with little to no intervention, in this regard it failed miserably as it had to be watched and helped along constantly. My house is large, but clutter free and is as simple an environment as this item would be expected to encounter.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated to get one of these because of the reviews saying it didn't do that good of a job, and because I thought it would be really noisy. It actually cleans the floor really well, and it is not that loud. It goes around the floor in a seemingly random pattern, but at the end the floor is clean. Of course it doesn't get behind things, I don't expect it to, but the part of the floor that's seen and walked on is clean. It's bigger than I thought it would be (13.5 inches across), so there are a few places it can't get to. The instructions say the dock needs 1.5 feet on either side, with 4 feet in front. I do not have that kind of wall space with an outlet, so I have it between two things, but it works just fine.PROS- Cleans all the pet hair and dirt from the floor.- Is not as noisy as I feared.CON (this is a pretty big con)- I could not get it to connect to the Wi-Fi. The app told me to join the roomba network then come back. I did. It then told me to join the regular network and come back. I did. Then it told me--again--to join the roomba network and come back...in an endless loop. I searched for help with this and found nothing. So, I am unable to program it and have to manually start it each time.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Of the cheap robot vacuums I've owned this is the worst one. It is actually starting to fill me with anger whenever I have to deal with it, which is constant.I had an early Neato vacuum years and years ago, pet editon since I have two cats. It did its job, it was super simple, it couldn't go under my kitchen rolly-counter but it could get over the lip into my bathroom, it almost always made it back to its base unless it found a forgotten sock or loose wire. It had a mildly annoying beep if it was stuck but not incessent. It had shitty battery life though and eventually it died altogether.Then I bought one put out briefly by Anker, of course it had great battery, that was never a problem. It could fit under my kitchen cart, it ocassionally got stuck trying to get into my bathroom but usually it worked its way out of problems, it may have beeped once or twice when it first got into trouble but then would stay quiet. It usually made its way back to the base, but if not it had such great battery life that it didn't actually need the base for a couple days. Anker stopped selling them though and while I think they're probably the same as the eufy ones? but I wasn't surewhen I broke my Anker while cleaning it (completely my fault) I thought I would try Roomba. I mean, roomba is the big brand and should be better. While this is a cheaper roomba it is more expensive than my earlier robot vacuums.Why I hate it- It is loud as hell, but doesn't do any better job- it gets stuck on the lip into my bathroom every time where the others were able to go in and clean that room- it can't get under the kitchen cart, it also gets stuck on my desk and another thing in my office because of that wierd little outcropping it has on top- when it gets stuck somewhere, or can't find the base, or is low on battery, or is sitting on its base but not charging it both tells me via text message and LOUD voice message - the voice message repeats LOUDLY every now and again, like in the middle of the night.- It finds the dock every 3rd or 4th time it runs. I live in NY, my apartment is not big. The dock is in a very central place, the other vacuums had no problems with their docks in that spot.- On the rare occasion that it can find its dock It often fails to charge because it can't get its finicky self onto the charger correctly, my other vacuums just backed up and re-docked. I think I might be able to fix this by taping the dock to the floor, but that wasn't necessary with the other vacuums- it has shit for battery life. Yesterday it started up on schedule but I turned it off because I was in the middle of something, but it didn't redock ... it wasn't doing anything, there was nothing that should have drained its batteries, but today it is dead.- The neato used a pattern to clean, the Anker bumbled around at random, both always managed to hit my whole apartment. The roomba I have to keep carrying into my living room, from which it constantly returns back into my hall without cleaning the living room. I have to barricade the sucker into the living room to get it to clear the largest room I have. The other robots had no issues whatsoever with this, I don't even understand how it is an issue.The good?The app works really well with it, impressively so.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely adore this little vacuum. I have a large one bedroom with hardwood and tile throughout, and it does a fantastic job of keeping the place clean. It even works under my couch and bed, places I'd maybe clean once a year before. It does a good job of returning to base, provided it doesn't get tangled up in something along the way. It only took a few cleans to identify all the things it didn't like and (mostly) roomba-proof my apartment. The serviceable parts are clearly labeled, easy to get to, and easy to clean which is a massive plus in my book.I'm knocking off two stars though, one for each area of my apartment the robot refuses to clean. This Roomba has the same bewildering problem that all previous Roombas have had, and that is that I can't disable the over-sensitive cliff sensors. I have no cliffs in my apartment, it's all one level, all hard floor, so there's absolutely no need for them. What I do have is a black checkerboard kitchen, and black bath mats. Roomba steadfastly refuses to go into the kitchen because of the black tile, and if it hits the bath mats it fails the clean and sits there until its battery dies. The robot does a great job of cleaning other colors of bathroom rug, and obviously shouldn't have a problem with tile.If you search the internet for this problem, there are hundreds of videos and forum posts dating back to 2012 of various ways to disable the sensors. Most involve putting some kind of foil or tape over them, but unfortunately they've changed the 600 series so that hack no longer works. The only one I've found that actually might work on mine is to open the device up (a couple dozen screws and many loose parts) and modify the sensors themselves. This voids the warranty.This is ridiculous. What's the deal iRobot? How hard would it be to put a toggle in the app to disable cliff sensors? I haven't tried the other brands of robot vacuum, but if they haven't fixed the problem by the time the battery in this one is going (an $80 replacement part), then that's where I'm gonna go. At least they listen to their customers.","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2019",23 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9988636374473572

The app only shows that a job is started or finished, how long it took and if the robot got stuck or ran out of battery. I can remember only one time that the robot left it's base, cleaned for an hour and then made it back to its base by itself to charge. It usually just runs out of battery after about 1.5 hours and I find it somewhere in the house. After vacuuming for an hour and a half, the bin is always full of dust and crumbs. I keep a clean house and have a cleaner come twice a month. If you don't have a robot vacuum, you are likely living in filth and just don't know it. There are some obstacles it doesn't handle well. It will get wedged under my futon if I don't put something in place to block it from going under. If there is a phone charging cable on the floor it will get tangled up in it.

The product manual talks about how if you run it frequently enough as a whole it will touch every surface.The main reason I gave poor Roomba a three star rating, is that it only makes it back to the base about half the time for me. Sometimes it gets wedged in underneath the cabinet. The other day it got stuck behind the door in the bathroom and just spun around till the battery died.

It was so amazing watching it navigate through every obstacle. And it picked up everything.  I have a dog with long white fur and he leaves it every where.  The Roomba found it and sucked it right up.The only thing that I don't like about it is that it didn't come with a remote control like my old one did.  It tells you to download an app to your phone, yada yada yada.  I don't have a fancy phone that I could do that with.  So I just touch the on/off button with my toe and off it goes.  It ran for around an hour and came back an docked itself into it's charger cradle.  I am very pleased with my unit and would recommend it to anyone.","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.957426905632019
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently moved into a new 2-story home with wood laminate downstairs (carpet upstairs) and didn't want to bring my vacuum up and down the stairs to clean both areas. I decided to keep my vacuum upstairs and bit the bullet and bought a Roomba for downstairs. My downstairs area is quite small (approx. 650 sq. ft.) but I have a decent amount of furniture so it is not what I would call an ""easy clean."" I also have a dog and a cat who shed A LOT, and as any pet owner know, hair finds its way into every crevice possible. So far my Roomba has done an amazing job picking up pet hair and dirt downstairs. It easily cleans the floor and rugs and seems to get ""smarter"" with each use navigating around furniture/obstacles. It runs for close to two hours (until the battery runs low) then docks itself back at the charging station. The app is awesome and allows you to schedule cleaning times/days so you can start the cleaning mode while you're at work or away from home.","Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9859440922737122

This does work amazing at picking up debris and hair on hardwood floors.The cons- I was very disappointed at the way it picks up hair on carpet. It just leaves so much behind, and the hair gets caught in the rollers, causing you to clean them pretty much after each use. It relys way too much on bumping into things to move, and for whatever reason, it will not move into my bedroom with carpet, it doesn’t like to go over the hardwood floor to carpet. I have to keep moving it in the room.Overall, this vacuum is great. It would be perfect for a household with no pets, and hardwood floors.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this robot vacuum to help keep up on the every day messes around our house. We mostly have hard wood floors with carpet only in our two bedrooms. We also have two dogs that shed like crazy, no matter what we do. I and my husband were constantly frustrated with the piles of dog hair that would accumulate around our house. Both working full time and spending only a couple hours each evening at home we didn't want to spend our nights, every night, vacuuming to keep up with the dog hair. So we purchased the vacuum to do the work for us. It has been amazing the difference in the state of our floors. I'm so in love with it and will deal with the few ""issues"" that I have with the robot. Personally I feel the robot is very loud when vacuuming, I'm not sure how people program it to run at night. It would keep me awake. I would prefer to run it at night as I'd rather not run it while I'm at work and potentially terrorize my dogs with this little vacuum running around. I'd been very disappointed if one of my dogs were to attack the vacuum and destroy it while I wasn't home. Second, when you tell it to go home, it still takes a good 5-10 minutes for it to find it's way back to home. The vacuum continues to clean and make circles till it gets close to the home base and can line up to dock. Neither of these issues are bad enough for me to not want to keep the vacuum, again because the flip side is my floors stay cleaner and I don't have to physically do the vacuuming. I will warn that the vacuum will not pick up every little spec, I never expected it to. But if that is a determining factor for you be warned. If you run it daily then yes eventually your floors will be darn near spotless as the vacuum runs in random patterns. So one day it may spend a lot of time running around your living room, the next it will run around your kitchen more. Over all your floors will be a lot cleaner with it running daily.

   Family with two cats here —We’ve tried multiple robot cleaners and as we found ourselves in the market for a new one, we thought this would be a great choice based on the reviews. However, because it only has one brush versus two like we’ve had in the past, it just couldn’t handle the job. We’d have to run it multiple times a day for it to have done a decent job and even then, it just didn’t meet our standards. Also, from day one it had a difficult time docking itself. It would either die before it could make it back, or struggle once it found the dock to place itself on top. We’ve not had this issue with other brands. Finally, after each job, I would have to clean hair and dirt out of the wheels and other parts of the vacuum. Again, didn’t have to do this with past robots & found it very tedious.

One piece of advice regardless of the model...  prep your area before starting Roomba.  It can and will get stuck in odd places (corners, under table and chair legs, shaggy rugs, etc.).  Give it a chance to run wildly throughout the intended area without obstacles interrupting or confusing it.  In order to return to its cradle after about  90 or more minutes of continuous operation, it has to be in the path of the IR beam sent by the cradle in order to dock.  Otherwise, it will run out of battery somewhere in the house and stop.  It will send an SOS message to your cell though. One of them is funny when it gets stuck somewhere...

It’s really annoying watching him bounce back and forth and not picking up the one thing you want him to. Probably best to leave him alone and run him more often to pick up the dirt when you’re not watching.5. Loud. I usually schedule him to run downstairs while I’m upstairs still asleep. He’s loud though, so it’s not super pleasant. Because I have a dog, I can’t run him while I’m not home, so I’m stuck doing it in the morning.

Missed it again. No weird entry, door, anything blocking. Nothing. When it finally went into the office (probably 3rd time trying) the 3 prong rotating brush (not clear on part names) caught on the end of a rug. This stopped the job (which I understand) and led me to go help it out. Except it broke off!!! I have used the Roomba less than 5 times and something already broke! Really?!? Ugh. Granted the replacement part is like $10 but on principle I'm disappointed to already have to buy something for it. Be prepared to do the same.Other areas to note: it misses parts in each room. I can still see cat litter throughout the house both randomly and in chunks (where didnt go over spot at all). Disappointing since this was part of why I wanted to purchase!

I personally love it because it does what I wanted it to do which was pick up the cat hair that seems to be appearing even right after vacuuming and sweeping. No it does not deep clean as it can’t fit into every crease and crevice of your house... so if you’re looking for it to look like a maid just left your house then don’t bother buying it. But if you would love some help keeping your house tidy but still having to sweep and or vacuum occasionally as it helps to keep the dust and cat hair down to a minimum, then I would say this is a yes for you.

I don’t have pets but I imagine it’d be good for pet hair too- So easy to use especially with Alexa integration. I literally just tell Alexa to start my roomba and that’s that!- Does seem to do well on both hard wood and carpeted areas. My apartment is about 70% carpet, 30% faux woodCons:- I can see how people think it’s a little loud. I don’t mind it while I’m reading or relaxing, but it’s hard to take meetings (currently working remote) with it on. When I watch the while it’s running, I turn up my tv volume a few notches- As shown in the picture, it kind of beats itself up with how many walls it rams into. After the first few runs, it was pretty scratched up on the bumper. It doesn’t bother me though- it is super good at picking up hair but I have to clean it out of the bristles every few weeks. The hair will really build up- It’s a little dramatic when transitioning from carpet to non carpet occasionally because it thinks it’s near a cliff. Sometimes it’ll go to clean my bath mat and I’ll have to go move it because it can’t get off the bath mat because it thinks it’s near a cliff- It seems to favor certain parts of my apartment as it’ll spend 75% of its time cleaning certain areas as opposed to others. This is consistent every time I run my roomba. It might just be that those areas really are super dirty- it doesn’t clean on dark carpet. This is the most annoying part for me. There are tons of YouTube videos on this but because of the way the infrared sensors work for making sure it doesn’t actually drop off a cliff, it doesn’t work on super dark colored carpets.Overall I super love my roomba and would definitely purchase again. I think the most annoying thing for me is the dark carpet issue but even with that, this purchase was still worth it","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9984601736068726
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loving my roomba!  Our floors are clean in places they have never been clean before.  It gets under beds and furniture.  At first I placed it in an out of the way spot in the front of the house.  I kept getting lost and was unable to find its way back to base.  I tried placing the base towards the center of the house and it returns to base every time.  Our house is 2400  square feet, so it does not do the entire house each time.  It runs for around 90 minutes.  If I was able to do it again, I would have spent the extra $200 for the smart mapping kind.  It goes up onto our large area rugs and carpet without a problem.  It kind of shoves around the smaller rugs and bath mats.  It’s picks up soooo much hair, fur, and dust bunnies.  We have a cat and a dog, and all of the floor fur is gone.

I think if I lived in a house that was sparsely furnished and laid out linearly it might be successful. That is not what I have. I live in a 1790's large home with very large rooms. The Roomba will never be able to find its way back to its charger, it doesn't stay in one room long enough to clean it, and it smashes into furniture like a blind person on crystal meth.  On a positive note, if I lock it in a bedroom with little furniture, it does a half way decent job and cleans under the bed-- a job I despise with a conventional vacuum. Last night I was upstairs watching tv and heard a strange noise downstairs, It was the Roomba, which magically went on a dust-busting expedition by itself. I found it dead and hung up on a door tread this morning. The other issue I have is that I've never been able to properly download the app so I could operate it wirelessly.

After comparing all the Roomba models, it seemed to me that all the extra features of the higher-end models were unnecessary. It does a pretty good job overall of picking up dirt and other debris on a wood floor, but if you prefer to have things really clean, you'll still have to hand-sweep once every few days. You can control it with your phone, and it tells you if there is any issue. If you're only trying to vacuum a certain area, you will need to physically block off the area or separately purchase a laser blocker. Even though I use it for the same area, it will occasionally get stuck. After it's done cleaning, it will automatically go back to its charger, which is a nice feature. It is a little bit on the louder side, but if you're not in the same room while it's cleaning, it's a non-issue.","Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.999083936214447

I really should have done more research before I purchased this and I've had this Rooma since March 22, 2020...Pros: works great on LIGHT colored carpet, easy to maintain (I use a dog grooming brush to clean the bristles of the copious amounts of animal fur), it's easy to locate with the location chime, and the app is pretty straightforward with reminders to clean the brushes and change out the filter.Cons: if you have ANY dark marks on the carpet, the stupid things sensors will get stuck because it detects a ""cliff"" which will then require you to move it to a new location before it can resume operations; it doesn't have very good mapping technology. It goes around the same way and has completely missed rooms and obvious spots of my 1200 sq ft house (half of which I don't even have it clean!) even after I set it up over the uncleaned spots; the battery doesn't last very long (1-1.5 hours of run time before it dies) so if you have a large house you will need more than 1 to clean all of your floors. The battery has died just doing my bedroom, which is only 120 sq ft.Overall, just having it do my bedroom is mostly awesome but the rest of my house is never clean unless I manually vacuum or sweep it. Either the battery dies before it finishes, it gets stuck on the dark patterns on my large living room rug and I refuse to get it since it happens CONSTANTLY (at least 5-6 times in the same spots each time it runs; hence why I say the mapping technology is rubbish), or it just doesn't go into the other rooms.I wish I had gotten a different Roomba...","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9795287847518921

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Many features do not work correctly. It does not return to base when battery gets low - it just stops wherever it is.  My main floor is large enough that it RARELY finishes on one charge, so I have to hunt it down and take it back to the base nearly every time.  It also does not sense when the dirt container is full, which is not helpful if I run it while I am gone, as I need to empty it several times (the dirt container seems very small to me).  It claims to be ""good for pet hair"", but the brush CONSTANTLY fills up with pet hair, after which it doesn't pick up any pet hair.  I need to remove the hair from the roller brush after every second cleaning or so.  It also gets hung up on edges of stairs REALLY easily (""Roomba is on a cliff"").

It gets stuck behind my recliners, gets hung up on any cord it encounters that is close to an object where it has to change direction.

I was watching it ""learn"" it's environment and watched it go right over my dogs hair as it ran. I don't expect perfection. After all a vacuum is only as good as the suction the motor creates. But this thing doesn't suck up anything. I wanted to use it to supplement my normal vacuuming to help keep the dog hair down. What a waste of money. I pissed away $200 bucks for something that is going to just take up space sitting on the docking station on my floor. I've tried this thing numerous times. This thing doesn't suck up anything. As mentioned in my previous post every time it transitions off the rug to the hardwood floor it leaves a pile of dog hair. AND it skips around and misses all kinds of areas.

We are very busy and the Roomba was supposed to help us clean our very messy dog-haired floors to ease us up from having to clean it constantly. This vacuum requires constant attention because it keeps getting ""stuck near a cliff"" WHEN THERE ARE NO CLIFFS AROUND. We live in a one floor duplex and it constantly gets stuck and we have to intervene. Constantly. Another thing about it is it will clean the same spot for 10 minutes, forgetting the rest of the floor. It doesn't have any sort of path and never gets everything.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I have wanted a Roomba since my brother got one 10 yrs ago, but seeing as I don’t live on 250K/year like him, I would never splurge a grand on a vacuum cleaner. Finally, prices have dropped on these older models and they seem to have the best reviews anyway, so I bit the bullet. Wish I would have spent the grand 10 years ago bc these are legitimately amazing!I will say that the first one that came in (refurbished) had been damaged in shipping. One of the sensors was busted and the packaging showed damage as well, so contacted Amazon - they re-shipped immediately, and Roomba 2.0 was here in 2 days, and this time they threw in a free virtual wall! Bonus!! (This little thing has proved invaluable, so get it if you can!!)First day, got home from work, opened it up, charged it, and before bed, picked up everything off the living room/kitchen area. It felt a lot like child proofing for a toddler. But we got anything you would pick up for regular vacuuming up and pulled the bar chairs out a little so it could get to the dirtiest areas. Used the virtual wall to block off the hall to the bedrooms, and went to bed (after watching in amazement for about 30 minutes!) Satisfied that it wouldn’t get stuck, finally went to bed. We could barely hear it running and bumping, but not bothersome at all. Almost like leaving a fan on while sleeping - it was nice white noise and I actually slept better knowing my house was being cleaned while I slept!!Next morning, I expected the floors to be clean, but it exceeded my expectations. I could literally feel the difference on my bare feet. Almost like it had been mopped and waxed. I mean this thing must have some serious suction. Emptying the filter reconfirmed this! We have 3 cats, my daughter and I have long hair, and my two boys track in all kinds of trash daily from just being in and out. It got it all! Plus, I guess you just don’t realize the amount of dust that collects on the floors. Anyway, the filter was full and it was really gross...So over the next few days, we have used it to clean all the rooms. I use the virtual wall and doors to contain it to one room at a time which works best since it only has about 2.5-3 hours of battery and it can really do a good job on one room at a time vs running it over the whole house. It even fluffed up my medium-high pile carpet in the bedrooms and covered every square inch even with the weird random pattern!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"As hard as I try to keep it clean in here, my cat is constantly making a mess of my apartment. Either food gets spread around the floor on its way into her mouth, or litter gets flung all over when she's done with it. I sweep and vacuum but it's a never-ending uphill battle.I run the Roomba every morning, and its base station is right across the room from the litter box. It's very simple to set it up to automatically run on a schedule. Its first order of business is to go and suck up the day's litter, then it bangs around for another hour and a half until its batteries die, it finds its way back to the charging station, or it sucks up a cord and cries for help. It's fairly loud so its essentially my alarm clock - impossible to ignore, and since it almost always gets into trouble, a reason to get out of bed.The way that it finds its way is frustrating but amusingly simple in its simplicity: it just drives straight until it runs into something, then turns in a random direction and tries again. There's no reasoning or planning involved, so sometimes it'll get into the bedroom and spend an hour bumping around under the bed until its battery dies. Sometimes it makes it under the TV and cruises over a power strip like a little monster truck, pushes a notification to my phone claiming  that it's ""stuck near a cliff"" and plays a very loud and spooky ""Error! Please move Roomba..."" recording.The cat is not afraid of it, and sometimes likes to watch it. Mostly she ignores it.The brushes collect a lot of hair, but cleaning them out is simple and easy without any tools. It doesn't clean deeply, but it does a lot more to keep the apartment clean by running every day than I do vacuuming once a week.

Anyone else who uses silica litter probably knows, stepping on a single piece isn't fun. Also, the amount of fur around my apartment was ludicrous. This vacuum helps so much. It doesn't have a huge capacity wastebin, but, for my apartment, it is plenty; provided I empty it after it runs. I have it linked with an iRobot account and my Alexa, and I love the expanded features, like being able to start it from anywhere in my apartment. I haven't tried to schedule it yet, I'm not sure how well that would work considering one of my cats likes to try and start it, and he knocks it slightly off the base. (As of yet, he hasn't figured out the button starts it, but I'm sure that is only a matter of time.) I check the robot every morning to make sure it is charging and run it in the mid-afternoon, when the cats are napping and unlikely to mess with it. I have to say, I run this every day, and I am constantly surprised at how much it actually picks up every single day. I didn't know how much dirt gets tracked into my apartment until I bought this vacuum.My one complaint, is that the front wheel gets a lot of fur stuck in it.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"For context, my living situation is in a second story apartment with myself, one other adult, and our medium-to-long haired white hair dog who has about average shedding (white hair is kind of hard to notice, but it's definitely there).The 675 is diligent about vacuuming, where I'm not. The first couple of runs filled the dust bin. Now, after running it once a day for about a week, the dust bin is significantly emptier each time I run it.  The front rotating brushes are already a little worn, and I can't imagine them lasting more than three or four months.  The part looks trivial to replace when they do wear out, which is good. The inner/central vacuum brushes pick up and get tangled with dog hair about on par with other non-robot vacuum cleaners. Recommendations are to clean out the brushes once a week, which seems about right if you're running your vacuum cleaner daily.I did an ""arts and crafts"" disable for all but one of the cliff sensors (I kept the one by the rotating brush alone).  The Roomba was having a bad day with a living room rug with a black border.  Scotch tape and white paper did the trick to disable the sensors in my case, and now it's working much better (though I imagine if I had stairs it would preform poorly with them). iRobot definitely doesn't recommend disabling cliff sensors under any circumstances, but there are videos floating around for various ways to disable those sensors with varying degrees of ""hackiness.""Maybe iRobot will figure out how to get the ""dumber"" Roombas to not stop for carpets with black borders some day. It's a notable complaint, and would be pretty bad if I had both stairs *and* carpets with black borders.  I don't have that scenario though, so I'm lucky and I'm fine with a hacked together solution.The robot vacuum gives the dog anxiety. He doesn't like the noise it makes or the fact it moves on its own accord.  The same dog also doesn't like regular vacuum cleaners, blenders, food processors, or similar appliances (though I'd put the Roomba at a level below the volume of those appliances). Personally, I wouldn't schedule the vacuum cleaner to run with the dog home alone (the dog is spoiled though, and is rarely home alone for very long).  Know your own pet when purchasing an appliance like this.Speaking of knowing your pet, also know your household. The Roomba isn't afraid to run smack into, say, the dog food water bowl or to try and vacuum stray dog toys.  There's some element of setting your Roomba up for success by being cognizant of your environment and either doing things like blocking off the dog food area, having proper cable management around your home, or cleaning up stray items and toys of various flavors before the robot runs a vacuum job.Even with all those caveats, I'm extremely happy, which is probably a testament to how awesome robot vacuum cleaners are.","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9959368109703064

The first time she ran, we needed to empty the bin twice. Since then, the floors are beautiful and and I empty the bin once a day when I get home. She has been running every day at 10am since we ordered it and is usually done in an hour or so and docks herself.2 Recommendations.  1 - hot glue the base to the floor.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Here's what I like about the Roomba.  It cleaned surface materials pretty well, including wood and carpet floors. It worked itself around most obstacles (but it did get frequently stuck). I liked the app to control it. Cleaning was easy and straightforward.Unfortunately, there were a number of issues.  It cleans randomly; it's not smart and it doesn't map. So it can spend a lot of time in one small area. The battery life is only 1-2h at most, and it could only clean part of the lower floor before needing a recharge. It got stuck frequently; wires, loose fabric, certain corners, under a table. And most baffling, the machine rarely found it's way back to the home base as advertised. Even when I put it in front of the base, it would sometimes head in the other direction.Now I understand this one of the cheapest Roombas, yet I did expect it do what it claimed, and it didn't work for me, so I'll be returning it. Perhaps I'd do better with a more expensive smart model.

As advertised, it offered an app to operate, but it wasn’t clear that there wasn’t an option of a remote.

Without the app, the only buttons are to clean, spot clean and dock. It doesn’t seem to learn the floor plan like my previous vacuum, frequently and repeatedly gets stuck under the same chairs, at door jams, etc., can’t seem to find the docking station (even when placed a foot away!)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good deal for a lower priced robo vac. Picks up a lot of dirt/debris. The hopper is small but filling it up 3-4 times a week makes a difference. Does not replace your standard vacuum. Is pretty noisy. Fits under most things, but not a low couch (like mine). Hooks up to wifi, you can schedule cleanings. Got stuck the first time out in a bedroom. Pushed open the door and the door swung closed behind it. Not really its fault. Did pick up a lot of dirt before getting stuck. Good entry into the category. When I upgrade would like something with a little more smarts (eg mapping).One other thing, it is a little hit or miss on the docking. If it is too far away docking doesn't happen.

Sometimes this can be resolved by simply clicking “resume,” but other times, it’s legitimately stuck on-or under-something)I do think it’s worth it, and I assume the more expensive ones would operate more quietly and get stuck less frequently.

My daughter was 9 months old and started crawling when i purchased this product. We don't have pets but my long hairs and my husband's body hairs were all around the apartment despite vacuuming almost everyday, but still my daughter could manage to find hairs tangled among her fingers and make me panic for not being able to get appropriate clean house that I wished I had. Besides I have to clean my apartment everyday while having a full time job (not easy, trust me). I looked for cheaper companies reviews, more expensive ones like Dyson as well and etc. Most cheaper robots mostly had bad charge keeping reviews, some of them even told about stopping working at all after few days of usage. Finally I decided to purchase from Roomba but a cheaper one, as it did not have complaining reviews about losing to keep charge day by day or bad suctioning ability. It arrived really fast and in a safe packaging. I am using it for almost 2 months now, everyday and it is amazing. I have 1180 sq. ft 2 bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen apartment with hardwood floors, and a small carpet in one bedroom. App works perfect and sends notifications when robot needs an attention. It got stuck under a couch few times, as it has gradual fall in height underneath ( I dont know how to explain it otherwise, sorry), but I fixed it by putting some books to the lowest parts to stop the robot to go in there, but you can purchase a virtual wall barrier as well to prevent the robot to go places where you dont want it to go. So it does not stuck anymore and completes its job in 90- 110 mins almost everyday and charge lasts the same like in day 1. And finally I am getting clean floors without hairs and dust.

It also bounces around the walls and cabinets like an old-fashioned pinball; you can never tell which way it is going to ricochet.Yes, like any vacuum, the hair from my Newfoundland and long-haired tiny lion do get wrapped around the brushes.  The brushes are very simple to remove from the Roomba once you remove the dirt catcher.  I use a pair of scissors to cut through one side of the tangled hair and then easily unwrap the hair from the brushes.  Then I snap them back in place, replace the now clean dirt catcher, and dock the pinball for another day.I don't use the Roomba as my full-time vacuum as it does not get in tight places well, but I run it a couple of days a week so the dog and cat hair stay under control until I can do a full vacuuming when I have a day off.  It keeps me saner and I definitely recommend it!","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2019",2 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9993513822555542
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great suction and does a great job cleaning up pet hair. Pretty good battery, lasts about 1.5 hour continuous on a full charge. Like I said, the suction power is really good and you can see the results both in the full filter and the lines left on the carpet. Only one real noticeable flaw. It's not always very smart and it often struggles to make it back to the base before the battery dies. I live in a small apartment so it's not like the base is far away or anything but it just doesn't seem to try until it's way too late. I'll get the notice on my phone that it has completed cleaning but I can see it's still just roaming around the living room and not even trying to head to the base in the next room. If I press the return to base button to manually force it to go ""home"" it still struggles and often will head in the opposite direction of where the base is located. Finally, with all that great cleaning and suction, comes a strong motor that is not very quiet. This is not a flaw but definitely something to be aware of.","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2019",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.5273422598838806

A few times it's been tied up on some obstruction. It seems to clean for a while before this happens, so not sure if it dies or what happens. Minor inconvenience picking it up and putting on charger, but better than vacuuming myself.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"We just received our new Roomba 675 via Prime a few days ago and have used it twice. According to iRobot’s website, this device should have come with an included cleaning tool, but it’s nowhere to be found in the packaging (see my attached pic from iRobot’s website).Anyhow, we have a very hairy puppy ( a 15-month-old Great Pyrenees) and this seemed to be the model to get for keeping his loose hair under control. Well, having used it twice in four days, I can say that it does a good job of getting our pup’s hair off the floor, in fact, perhaps too good of a job. I’ve run just two cleaning jobs with it and have already had to perform a thorough cleaning of the brushes, filter, sensors, charging contacts, etc., as the device was full of dog hair after just two cleaning jobs. Additionally, it got hung up a few times on rugs and cords during those two cleaning jobs and had to be manually repositioned in order to continue cleaning.On the second job, our Roomba 675 failed to automatically return to its home base and instead played a vocal track telling us to manually put it on its charger/base. The battery seemed not to be charging, so I performed the thorough cleaning that I mentioned above hoping that it might alleviate the non-charging issue. It now appears to be charging normally, so we’ll see how it holds up.

After the reviews I was nervous because some people made it sound like an aimless wanderer that got stuck everywhere.

I empty the canister and am always happy with the huge hair ball it produces. 2. It’s so easy to use on my app. 3 Fits under all the furniture easily Cons: 1. It’s not gong to get all of the hair when there is a rug that meets wood floor. It’s a very small amount that it misses 3. It’s too noisy to run while sleeping if you’re a light sleeper... it bumps into stuff and while it’s less noisy than a regular vacuum it’s not super quiet either.My tips: put your chairs up before you clean and block off areas where it could stuck with a blanket !

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have considered purchasing this item for several years as a dog owner, and finally decided to get it. I run the vacuum once a day so far. It is not the smartest, I am perplexed the paths it chooses although I think it does a ok job picking up dog hair and dust on this daily basis. The bin is quite small for the amount of hair my dog delivers around the house. So, most likely I will have to run the vacuum more often and try to limit it to the dog’s favorite room. While it is convenient to have to avoid the accumulation of dog hair, it is definitely not a replacement for a real vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9979928135871887
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this product for a few months now and I have basically given up on it.  I note that it is very bad at picking up pet hair.  Basically, all it does is push the hair around and create piles of hair next to the corners of carpets (please see pictures).  The room actually looks worse when the job is ""done"" because it extracts pet hair from the carpet and deposits it where it's more visible.  Vacuuming again with a real vacuum is a must when you use the Roomba.  Really disappointed that this has amounted to little more than a $250 toy, since it hasn't really reduced the burden of cleaning up pet hair messes.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2021",3 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.999761700630188
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We named her Rosey.  Definitely a female robot.  Does not go any direction using a logical path.  Just when you think you've figured her out, she changes her mind and does something different.  She sometimes finds a spot that you wouldn't think needs run over a dozen times - and goes at that one area a dozen times, leaving other areas as yet untouched.  With that said you have to trust her.  She will get to 99% of the floors eventually, just some areas more than others.She hauls butt too.  You'd think she thinks company is coming and this vacuuming needs done NOW!  Low profile means she will get under most furniture and tables.  Edge cleaning is amazing.  Rosey does all this with minimum noise.  We can watch TV while she runs amok through our 6 room main floor.I think Rosey grew up on the East Side as she does not have a delicate manner.  She will run head on into whatever is in her way.  I can see where a vase on an end table would be knocked to the floor.  Not a problem for us, but you may want to pretend a toddler is on the loose in your house before you let her loose.Rosey does seem to get herself out of jams okay.  In a month of cleaning we only had to rescue her once when she got hung up on a power cord that I should have secured away anyway.  Most rugs on a hardwood floor are handled okay.  We had an issue with one area rug that Rosey would bunch up because it slid on the floor too easily.Dog hair is gone.  Great on that.  Easy to clean, and all rollers, etc are easy to clean when needed.  All I can tell you about battery life is that ours exceeds 90 minutes and still has half a charge.

We got our second fluffy dog this past summer and I just couldn’t take the hair tumble weeds. We have a mix of hardwood, area rugs, and upstairs carpet. This is the second night running it and it’s wonderful. We pick it up and move it around as needed, but you could go all fancy with the additional accessories and such too. I bought the cheapest model because I was afraid of the reviews about it getting stuck on everything. I figured I should start with a $265 model in case I was let down. I don’t think she is deep cleaning, but she is cleaning far more than I was every day. I run it once my son has gone to bed so that I can pick up his toys and such. Sure, it would be wonderful if Roomba stood up, put on a French maid outfit, and did all that for me, but the way I look at it, I had to do all that with the regular vacuum. At least now, I don’t have to lug around a cleaner. Plus, I’m not going to set the timers and risk that my son or dogs have left any kind of hidden surprises.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update4.15.20 now won't charge seems contacts having trouble making connection. I tried one of these when it first came out. I was very dissatisfied. Mainly the area they call the dust bin. So if you have pets , like a long hairy dog, you know what kind of hair they can shed. I really debated on a 500 dollar model of another brand I think shark that had a separate bin to empty into. First this thing is kinda noisy. You don't want it running while you home. I bought it this time because I got new wood floors. Got rid of carpet. If you have carpet don't buy this , so I swept first to help it out. So it comes on and drives around a few minutes . I thought I would test the dock feature. From ten feet away it could not find its way back. Also I started to buy another model with brushless rollers. After one vaccum I had to take this apart, remove brush which was totally clogged with dog hair. Had to take scissors and cut hair off the brush. Its designed just like a human hair brush, which is terrible for dog hair. Then there's the dust bin. Common sense tells you if the bin is small then you going to have trouble. Sure enough it was packed , so if you have a wad of dog hair about the size of your fist, that's it, that's all it holds . So basically if you start out with brand new floors and your pets live outside and never come in and this bot runs daily all day, then maybe it's ok, for real world situations it's not worth it . I recently after years bought a big upright vaccum with brushless rollers. Best thing I ever did. It think it was a shark, but mainly it's the rollers. If they have brissels like a human hair brush don't buy it.So I would spend the extra money and try for a robot with the rubber fins instead of brissels like a human hair brush unless you like getting scissors out all the time to cut hair off rollers. Then look for one with a bin to unload in. I did see I think a shark for 500 . This 675 is NOT  for pets and should not be advertised for pets, also there are several kits you can also get that that has extra roller brushes for this model, go ahead and order one or two you will be needing to replace the dollar very soon. Also look for one of these robots with brushless rollers, the kind it comes with has brissels like a human hair brush , I have to remove the brush every time I use it and take  sissors to cut out tangled hair .

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to leave a review, because this model had so few I almost didn't buy it in the first place, but it has been amazing! We have a dog, a cat, and cedar trees in the front and back yard so we are always tracking in little bits of cedar everywhere. Our house has standard house carpet (low-med pile), hard wood, linoleum, and various textured rugs. So far, the only thing I've seen the roomba struggle with is one very ""high-pile"" shag rug we have in front of the sink. It doesn't seem to struggle with any obstacles, though I do use it as an excuse to pick up all our socks and junk off the floor, which has an added benefit of encouraging me to keep a tidier house. It's only needed help getting 'unstuck' once, and when I heard the noise and tracked it down I found that it had ambitiously mounted the base of our cat's climbing tree and high-centered itself. The one draw-back I've noticed is that it doesn't alert you when the debris compartment is full, it just stops picking stuff up as well. But I've found if I run it 3 times a week (it takes about 40min to do our whole small house) the smaller volume of debris from regular maintenance means I don't have to empty it mid-job.Overall I'm very pleased with it. I absolutely hate vacuuming, so I view it as kindof an assistant, and will often do other chores while its running. The first night it cleaned the kitchen, I just followed after it with a wet rag and mopped down the corners of the floor. My house hasn't been so clean since we moved in! I even took it in a backpack to work and let it loose in my office, since we don't have a cleaning service and it was getting gross under my desk. XDI actively chose this model because it didn't come with the barrier tower things. we're trying to be more minimalist, and I don't want a bunch of extra tech just cluttering up the place.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Review written by Christopher's wife.I loved the idea of a Robot Vacuum. I still do. But I love the idea of one that works well. The Roomba 675 is, unfortunately, not that. We did know ahead of time that this vacuum was the type that bounced around aimlessly until it was finished cleaning, and we did wonder how it would get everything clean, but we had read/seen good things and decided to give this one a shot. Sigh. This has turned out to be the robot vacuum that bounces around aimlessly until it ultimately gets stuck somewhere or runs out of battery trying to find its home. We've had it for several days now, running it during the night and sometimes during the day, and it has yet to impress us or even make us think it's worth its weight. We were going to give it an entire week, but we have determined that it is pointless to continue giving it opportunities to impress us.We have to close the powder room door because it thinks that our daughter's toddler potty is a hill to try to climb. One morning we were notified that it was stuck on a cliff. We came downstairs to see that it was simply up against a toy in the playroom. We moved our kitchen mats and stood them on their sides, leaning them up against the couch to block the path to the toys pushed under the couch. In the morning we learned that it had gotten stuck trying to mountain climb the mats, wedged itself between the mats and a chair, somehow turned around, but was unable to climb down forward. We had to move the docking station because it was unable to find it after telling it to go home. It wandered around for 10-15 minutes before finally finding it's docking station. It has gotten stuck underneath our easy chair. It has run out of battery before making it home, leaving us to go on a quest to finally find it chilling in the dining room. We are not surprised when it cannot finish a job due to being stuck or running out of battery life. We'd likely be surprised to find it in the morning resting peacefully in its docking station. But alas, we don't expect that to happen, and will thus be returning it.One positive is that it does well with the spot clean feature.

Bought this to try to keep the dog hair on the floor under control. My house is all tile accept for the two guest bedrooms.  Total area is over 2100 sq ft. I initially placed the charging base in the master bedroom.  Roomba ran well but couldn't find its way back to the charging base.  Otherwise I was impressed with it's ability to get under things and find its way out of tight spaces.  I moved the base to the kitchen table area.  It's part of the open concept great room.  I hoped it would be able to detect the infrared beam from the base better in a more open area.  Worked great the first couple of times and then it got stuck in a bedroom when it sucked part of the drapes into a wheel.  I decided to keep the guest bedroom doors closed to see how it worked.  Next run it never got stuck but battery died in the master bedroom when it couldn't find its way out and back to the kitchen to get to the base.  Not really surprised since the master bedroom is a fairly long way from the kitchen.  I added a second charging base in the master bedroom.  This has mostly solve the issue of not being able to return the base as there is now one in each of the 2 largest spaces in the house, the great room and the master bedroom.  Yesterday it somehow managed to back under the china cabinet and wedge itself in too tightly to get out.  Not sure how this happened since it doesn't normally go backwards. Even with these annoyances I'm happy with the results.  The bin holds capacity has been more than adequate.  The first 3 runs did completely fill since it was going under furniture I hadn't been too thorough in vacuuming beneath. Now the bin bin is about 1/3 full after a complete cleaning cycle.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give this iRobot 4.5 starts. It’s great, not perfect but I’m pretty impressed with how it cleans. It does a nice job getting under furniture, and going a round table legs. I would say it’s totally worth it and wish we got one sooner.After about 10 days of owning it and running it once a day, I swiffered the whole house to see what I would find. I was very impressed with how little dirt I picked up. Normally it would have taken multiple swifter pads and been pretty gross.It does need a little babysitting but not much. It does favor certain rooms, I have to kick it out of the bathroom cuz it will go in the bathroom like ten times.It’s kinda annoying, it bumps into everything and is pretty loud.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"When purchasing a Roomba, properly setting expectations is key. Yes, the Roomba will travel in a random pattern and sometimes get stuck or cover the same area multiple times. Yes, you have to put some thought into the area being cleaned for the robot to be effective (e.g., shut the door to a bathroom with a thick rug, pick things up off the floor, invest some time in cord management behind the sofa). No, this is not the product for you if you want cleaning service-like vacuum lines on your carpet.I am someone who keeps a very clean home — the kind that makes people wonder if anyone actually lives there. I continue to be floored by how much hidden dust and small particles the Roomba picks up, even with just one day between uses. The real value of this product is being able to kick it off when you’re leaving the house, or jumping in the shower, and discovering afterwards how much hidden dirt would still be on your floors had the Roomba not done it’s job. It’s a no-effort refresh of my home that allows me to spend my time elsewhere, and cleans in places that I wouldn’t normally touch on a weekday (e.g., under the sofa or bed).If you’re already pretty tidy and want to be even cleaner, this is the product for you. If your house isn’t normally “picked up” and needs deep cleaning, then this probably isn’t what you are looking for.Minor issues with docking, etc. are annoying but not deal breakers. The worst thing that happens is that the Roomba never makes it home, dies after cleaning, and has to be manually placed on the charger.While the self-emptying models are probably nice, I didn’t want to look at the extra apparatus in my home, and I like to monitor what the Roomba picks up.

   I will start off by saying that the iRobot Roomba has definitely helped my family with the day-to-day cleanup.My wife and I recently welcomed A firstborn son into the family. In the beginning, it was a struggle to keep up with the household chores while one of us went to work and the other stayed home.  The baby did not like the loud vacuum we had, and taking the vacuum in and out each day was a big hassle, not to mention took one of us away from the baby.I purchased this product so that it could do the cleanup after feedings, and pick up the items that we might have missed. Out of the box it worked fantastically! Yes it runs around the room a bit randomly, but it’s still gets the job done hugging the walls, and doing the different rooms that we have. The vacuum is decently quiet for what it is able to do, and on multiple occasions has not woken up our son when he is sleeping in the evening and for daily naps.This model does not have room recognition, so it will clean any area that you leave open. If you really want that level A vacuum where you can ask her to clean specific rooms, go with a newer model.The only issue that I have right now with the Roomba, is that It will not go onto our very short shag carpet. After contacting the iRobot team, they said none of their models would be able to clean a shag carpet. They suggested putting the Roomba onto the carpet to start, but that did not help.","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9974311590194702

My only complaints are that it is pretty thick and will get wedged under things, doesn't always backup when detecting a ""cliff"" which means you have to go save it (it does alert you through the app when both of these things happen and you can have it make an audible sound to make it easier to locate), and finally, (this is more of an OCD thing) but it only vacuums on a zig-zag pattern so the vacuum lines are not pretty on the carpet.","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9941849112510681

(Will update actual product after we’ve used it a while).I purchased this thru amazon warehouse for $150. I was expecting “fair, with damage” condition but I was ok with that due to it being half price and also... It’s a vacuum cleaner, not a livingroom center piece. The “damage” was to the exterior of the box. The unit does not look like it was ever even opened (so either it’s brand new or someone did a fantastic job cleaning and repackaging it).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Roomba is something I always had on my ""Wish List."" I waited for YEARS to get one, and now there are so many different versions of it I was so confused ordering. Reviews helped me the most in choosing, which is why I'm taking the time to review this one!I have 2 dogs, and 2 cats. My two dogs are 75 pounds each, full of sand at ALL TIMES (current construction in the back yard does NOT help). We had sand everywhere, AT ALL TIMES. Our furniture (even with the pads on the feet) started scratching our new wood floor because we couldn't keep up with the fur and the sand every day. We bought Shark Stick vacuum from Target, used it a couple of times, but realized we are honestly way to busy/lazy to spend our time vacuuming ourselves! That vacuum is now a dust collector in the closet, as we decided to bite the bullet and just try out the Roomba. We opened it, let it charge overnight (only needs 2-3 hours) and used it one Saturday morning. This thing just started scooting around, cleaning up corners I hadn't reached with a vacuum in weeks! It did have trouble docking the first time, as we chose a bad spot to keep the charging base. The charging base is the only thing I would change. it seems a little light weight and would be better if it was heavier and easier for the Roomba to dock to it without being SOLID against a wall. Anyways, once we moved it, it works perfectly every time now! We connected Roomba to our Alexa, and when we leave the house we pick up the dogs toys, and tell Alexa to turn on the Roomba. We come home to a fully charged Roomba, and a beautifully clean house! Our dogs don't mind it when they are by it, and our cats don't even know it's there.We also use it on our second level, but we only use it down there when we are home as it can't make it back up stairs to the charging dock on it's own (obviously). But again, we either press the clean button down there, or tell Alexa to start the Roomba and continue on with our daily tasks, not even thinking about physically vacuuming the house ourselves. We replaced all the soft pads on our furniture, repaired our floors in the places it was scratched, and now our furniture glides like butter across them! **We have a huge rug in our downstairs living room, and Roomba has cleaned this very well without getting stuck, but most of our house is tile or wood floors. Roomba did get stuck on my bathroom rug, but it stopped immediately and had no damage to the Roomba what so ever!Another note, Our couches are too low to the ground for the Roomba to fit underneath (Not Roomba's fault) so before we turn the Roomba on, we will sometimes slide the couch forward a foot that day, so it gets a bit under the couch. Then when we get home, we slide the couch back. The next day we will slide the couch backwards a foot, and when we get home move it back to it's original place. (Sand creeps under the couch frequently is the only reason we have to do this)Another random side note- The Roomba has a very easy to clean basket! (ours is full EVERY DAY) which is embarrassing, and makes anyone wish they didn't have 4 animals and a messy husband, but whatever :) They recommend replacements of different parts every couple months/twice a year depending on the part. We found a 8 pack of each part online(Amazon) for $20 TOTAL, so maintenance on this device is going to be low cost as well.All around- saved my sanity and I can go barefoot in my house!","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9902838468551636

I'm shocked at how much pet hair this thing picks up each afternoon!As I said, I still need to do thorough vacuums every once in a while, but not nearly as often which is amazing. It does run into some weird problems - such as thinking the edge of my very low rug is a ""cliff"" or finding its way under my dining room table but unable to find its way out.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched several different models of Roomba and settled on this one for several reasons. First, I have a dog. I wanted it to be able to pick up all the extra fur he’s dropping all over the place. Second, I have both tile and carpet- I needed it to be able to conquer both.After having this little Zumba Roomba for a month and a half or so, I am super pleased! My expectation was to be able to run this buddy between deep cleans and help stave off the build up of shed fur and BOY does Zumba Roomba do his job! A normal vacuuming every 2 weeks helps keep this place very clean.Key points to remember: it’s just a robot. It’s not exceptionally smart at remembering where it’s already been. If that is what you are looking for, up your price point to one of the newer models of Roomba. Something that drives my husband crazy is there is no straight lines or rhyme/reason where Zumba Roomba goes, though that doesn’t bother me at all. It will get stuck under tables and on high pile throw rugs every once in a while.Also- yes. Yes we did name our Roomba “Zumba.”  It’s 2020 and it makes me giggle.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.6598157286643982

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased two of these machines and this is my opinion. The one that I have at my work office works great because it's a large square room. Only a few times has the machine died trying to find the dock. However, I have one for my home, and it's the worst investment for my home I have ever done. First of all, it doesn't pick up dog hair at all... horrible suction. I have literally stood and watched it roll right over a piece of dog hair and left it there. Second, it never knows where to go... always makes its way into an area/room and will it there spinning in circles for 15-20 minutes because it can't get out! the base is so lightweight that you cant place it on anything but carpet to dock because the machine, when trying to dock, pushes the base all over the place and can never dock. So you would have to use sticky tape or something to hold the docking station in place... which might ruin your floors. So I have placed it in the wide-open living room on the carpet and it still can't dock on its own. I have had the one in my house for 4 months now and run it every morning and not one time has it docked on its own...it always dies somewhere and I have to hunt it down and place it on the dock.","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9992170929908752

I don't like to sweep and although my house was picked up and tidy, it often felt dirty. I've had the irobot for 3 weeks now. I run it almost daily and my floors are so clean. I don't even have to mop as often and there is less dust because it cleans under my couches, furniture and beds. It is amazing! My house is a 4 bedroom with a living room and den so I run it for an hour and a half in one half of the house, let it charge, then run it in the other half of the house. I clean out the collected dirt tray everyday because I don't want it to be full. Once a week or as needed I clean out the brushes and parts that build up hair. My daughters and I have long hair so it doesn't bother me to clean the brushes. I am reminded of all the hair I didn't have to sweep up. People think it is pricey but the time it is freeing up in my life is worth the price. I really don't have many complaints. I'm telling all my family and friends to get one.I can control it through my phone and my Alexa. It goes over my area rugs and from hardwood to carpet with no problems. It doesn't suck up curtains or bed skirts and if it happens to snag something it stops and I am alerted. All the things that I thought could go wrong are not a problem.

It zigs and zags all over the place so the noise is constantly bothersome3) Rugs - I have all wood floors with 2 very low pile rugs.

It just runs until the battery runs out, and depending on your house/apartment, it might be hard to find and rescue. Manually docking it is really annoying: it needs to be positioned extremely precisely or it won't charge.When it does dock automatically, it usually doesn't charge. I have to wiggle it around for 1-2 minutes until it starts charging. The scheduling feature in the app is pretty useless since I have to do everything myself anyway.There are problems while it's vacuuming too: it often gets stuck, it often gets clogged, it bumps into things violently. Sometimes it gets stuck on nothing. It often yells ERROR 23452345 CHECK THE APP. But there's nothing in the app.There are even problems while it's docked and should be doing absolutely nothing. Sometimes it randomly starts vacuuming in the middle of the night. Sometimes it randomly yells ERROR.The app is poorly designed. You know how you can schedule repeating alarms on iPhones and Androids? And you can disable those schedules without deleting them completely? Seems like a no-brainer, but the Roomba app doesn't let you do that--you can only delete schedules.Definitely do not get this if you have pets. If a pet poops or vomits, the Roomba will smear it everywhere. The manufacturer's official solution is that you should inspect ""floor conditions"" every time you vacuum. So it's yet another task you need to perform yourself. Even if you can get past the ""poopocalypse"" problem, there are plenty more. If a pet slightly bumps into the Roomba, it just starts vacuuming.There are many other issues when the Roomba works ""correctly."" It's loud and it takes 1-2 hours to vacuum.

I downloaded the required iRobot app and got through to the final step where it continually displayed and error message, “cannot connect to internet, try moving base closer to wifi”. So I tried one last time with the unit literally NEXT TO the wifi antenna.  No luck.  OK, so I figure I’ll just have to use it without the wifi. Theres a big button on the top that says “Clean”. I pressed that and off the roomba went.  It wandered around the house for an hour or so, then died without returning to the base as it was supposed to do. For the last two weeks, we have started the cleaning cycle at night before going to bed each night.  Each morning, I come down to find the roomba dead somewhere in the house, without returning to the base.  Once it became entangled on the fringe of an area rug. All in all, not much of a help or time saver, except that it can clean a bit beneath the furniture. It’s fun to watch it motor around but it clearly isn’t as automatic or smart as the company claims it to be.","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9995146989822388
5.0 out of 5 stars,"2021 UPDATE: STILL IN LOVE. I have used and abused my Roomba - often running more than once a day (especially when I am working from home and can easily put him back on the charger as soon as he finishes). Roomba has really helped motivate me to keep my floors clear of clutter for him, and on top of that does a fantastic job cleaning.  I do sometimes wish he could find his way back to the base, but honestly it hasn't been terrible having to track him down. I have a dog, and Roomba has NEVER failed to find a fistful of fur, even though I run it every day/multiple times a day. I cannot see any fur, but roomba still finds it.This guy is not smart (e.g. does not do the mapping advertised in the 900 series) and kind of just bumps around like a drunken sailor. BUT he cleans my 2 bedroom apartment FAR more thoroughly than I ever did, and coming home to a clean carpet has really motivated me to clean other areas, like dishes and laundry. Maybe this just came at the right time in my life, but this guy is everything I hoped for. It's reasonably quiet - I would say it's the same noise as an RC car, which is not silent but very tolerable, at least to me.","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2019",2 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9989563822746277

   The Roomba was really great at the beginning. We use it for a shop with concrete floors. Really made a difference at first. Not long after we started using it, it was clear that the little metal contacts on the bottom were getting dusty and weren't making good contact with the dock, so that the Roomba kept trying to dock over and over again. We would just pick the Roomba up from wherever it died, clean the contacts, and then set it on its dock. Now, however, even with cleaned contacts, the Roomba still doesn't seem to make contact with the charger. It tries to dock over and over, each time shoving the dock all over the place, so that it ends up pointing in some random direction, making the process even more impossible. The dock weighs nearly nothing and needs to be heavier in order to withstand the force of the Roomba as it tries to ""park"" on it. We tried to tape it down, but the Roomba just dislodges the tape.","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2019",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9979633688926697

On the hardwood floors it gets a little of the dog hair, but not enough to warrant the cost.  It just blows it around. The brushes spin, hit it, and out it comes flying!

Oh, I’m currently sending it to Home Base and I started that command 15 minutes ago.

1.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATE:  I would NOT recommend this for wood floors.  We started seeing white marks that look like scuffs or dirt on the floors.  It will not come off with regular cleaning.  I am now trying to figure out how to get these marks off my new wood floors.  I have subsequently read that this item can damage some wood floors.  I am hoping I can get the marks off but I would not recommend this product for use on wood floors.Overall very good for the value.  We have lots of pet hair and dust due to construction but this still cleans up very well.  Only negative is that you really have to clean it out good each time after cleaning.  This has lots of spots for pet hair to get stuck in.  Works better on dirt.

I would run it after I ran my big vacuum and it still picked enough stuff to fill it'shuge dust bin.  So I gave the older cheaper model to my son in order to buy a more expensive brand name version...BIG mistake! First the dust bin is tiny and I would have to empty it out at least twice during it's running cycle, when it was actually working.  The filter takes up too much room in the dust bin. It will run for almost two hours but leaves all kinds of stuff behind and I would have to come behind it with the big vacuum. So what is the point?? It ran for two hours this morning. I went to empty the dust bin after about 45 min. and the dust bin was EMPTY! It had not picked up anything.  Took all the brushes out and cleaned everything, tried it again. It was a bit better this time at least there was something to empty.  In my opinion the cheaper vacuum cleaned better at a year old than this one did brand new!

Wall-E gets in every nook and cranny, gets under the couch and chairs, and leaves the floors looking great. I have a chocolate Lab and a Shiba Inu that leave hair and dust bunnies all over. Wall-E picks it all up.

It does require maintenance every month or so to clean the bristles to assure that the brushes are not covered in hair or fur (we have a cat). The sediment bin is too small so cleaning it every after run is advisable otherwise the suction power goes low. It does the job IF it completes it but 90% of the time it gets stuck somewhere.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"We were looking to replace our old iRobot Roomba 870 model because it had stopped docking itself. We had the 870 for about 4-5 years and thought we would go with another Roomba since it did a good job. We were looking for a model that was great at picking up dog hair. We have a dog with long hair (Husky-Shepherd mix) and our old Roomba cleaned the pet hair pretty well. THIS 675 model was not a good replacement. It has been returned.CONS:- Roomba's are generally very loud machines and this newer model is not any quieter.- The 675 does not clean pet hair well. It uses bristle brushes and the hair gets caught and tangled in the brushes. See photo. Our older model had rubber-like brushes with no bristles.- Drops pet hair and debris when transitioning from area rug to hardwood floors, so you'll find hair along the edges of your rugs.- Stops for no reason. I would start the cleaner and then when I would walk back into the room, it had just stopped, no obstruction, nothing around it - just stopped.- It did not retain a charge very long. If not redocked, it would run out of juice in less than 12 hours. My old one would start back on the scheduled time if not redocked for 2 days.- The BIGGEST negative was the dirt reservoir (See photo). The design puts the filter inside the reservoir chamber. This means you have to CONSTANTLY empty it during its' cleaning cycle. Ridiculous! There was not a filter in the reservoir of my old 870 and I got ALL the space for trash. I generally did not have to empty it until the cleaning was finished with my 870.This machine was not worth the effort, frustration and glitches. I am so glad we did not give away our old one yet. I will just keep picking it up and putting it on the dock - at least it picked up the dog hair - until I find a model that does what I need it to.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2021",2 people found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9988619685173035

I’ve owned one other automatic vacuum from a different brand (DeeBot) that was SO much better and less expensive. Ive been using my iRobot for about 8 months and it causes me daily frustration. It never works how it’s supposed to. Sometimes it stops for no reason as if it’s stuck on something and tells me I need to clean the brushes, but there is nothing stuck in them. It doesn’t clean the entirety of my apartment (900 sq ft) and I never feel like my floor is clean after it runs. It only docks itself half the time even though I placed the charger in a spot with 6 feet on either side and in front, as the directions say, which has to be in my hallway which is an eye sore. With my DeeBot I could charge it underneath my entertainment center which was hidden and out of the way and it would still find its way back 100% of the time. I went to go run my vacuum today only for it to say it had low battery- it’s been charging all night! It’s incredibly loud as well. The only redeeming quality of this vacuum is the customer service. I’ve had to interact with them a few times because of an issue I was having with the vacuum and their responses and mail deliveries are always prompt. Otherwise, please go buy another brand.

Great invention.  Love it.","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9984155297279358
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Is the hair stuck in the rush free or do I still owe money. So far cat get it to charge and definitely was used or at least kicked down 3 flights of stairs caught by a group of kids with sticky fingers and puppies. If by the grace of god this thing works at all like I heard I’ll change my review but as of right now, I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9984992146492004
1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work very well with dog hair. Have to vacuum every other day to keep up with the hair it leaves behind. This is forgivable as dog hair is a challenge. What is not forgiveable is after less than 3 months of use it no longer charges. Can sometimes out something underneath it to get it to connect with pins and charge but this only works sometimes. Overall extremely disappointed with this product. I can understand not being to keep up with a multi dog household but to not function correctly after 3 months is unforgivable. If I could give 0 stars I would.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9933362603187561
3.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my second robot vaccuum, and unfortunately it only served it's purpose for a few months and I will not buy the same model again.  It lost the ability to seat itself properly on the charging station.  So for the first few times I dealt with the problem by setting it on there manually. But after awhile even that became problematic as it would take multiple attempts before it hit the sweet spot.  Sometimes I would give up, and then randomly it would come on later and try again and again to seat itself to no avail.  I did not drop or otherwise damage the unit or the charging station, so I have no idea why this problem started. Boo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9996845722198486
5.0 out of 5 stars,Had an Ecovac previously. I was a bit concerned when I saw this had only one of the little brushes as the Ecovac has two but ....This does a Much Better job ! With 3 dogs and a cat I can say it honestly works extremely well picking up all the hair ! We run it every other day into every room and it does a great cleaning job . We have wooden floors and area rugs and it cleans all just great ! Only wish it had come with a remote though ! But we got it for  great price so I can’t complain ! I definitely recommend these to everyone!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9979154467582703
4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this robot. We have had it for 3 days now and I will let you know the issues we have encountered. 1) we have to pick up our rugs (pictured) before it starts it’s process. 2) I should have researched more to find out mine doesn’t have the mapping feature. All in all we come home to a clean house and I don’t have to vacuum now. Oh btw the app works great and have had no issues with it yet!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9961773157119751
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, but very slow and loud. It’s hard to watch tv with this going on, just to give perspective. But I love that I can do other things while this is running, despite its slow speed. It’s sometimes hard to remember to empty it every session, and it’s always getting stuck on a rug or area where it can’t figure out how to get around, but my kids love rescuing it! It works for what I want it to do and that’s just keeping my floors visibly clean- but I still like to deep clean with my big vac at least weekly.","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9922647476196289
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This item is terrible. I bought one for myself to pick up the little things-- dust, hair and pet hair. The first week it kept crashing into furniture and just circulating over one part of my kitchen and didn't know how to circle into other rooms. It also thought my living room rug was a wall, not enough power to run over it and onto the rug to clean. I found myself constantly having to pick it up and place it in another location so that it could cover the areas that needed attention. The last straw was when I brought in my christmas tree, and the roomba couldn't even pick up the needles that fell from the tree.Secondly, I think it's important to note that I returned TWO roombas. The one I purchased for myself and the one I purchased for a relative over the holiday. She said her's couldn't do the bare minimum either. Save your money and get yourself something better that ACTUALLY works.","Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,NEGATIVE,0.9995205998420715
